var transcripts = 'Hello, Iowa. Congratulations to the Iowa hawkers. That was a big win today. I�m thrilled to be back. That was a big win. But I am thrilled to be back especially on such great news as that, that was a big one. You�ve been a great school, a great team, a great tradition, really an amazing job and it all started right here and we�re going to keep it here. Number one, right? We�re going to keep it here. The fairgrounds so they broke the record tonight in the history of the fairgrounds. I don�t know how old it is, but in the history of the fairgrounds, this is the most people they�ve had. So thank you very much. Donald Trump: (01:00) And all of you who are hard working American Patriots that we know and we love you all, as we get there tonight, millions of Americans are realizing that Joe Biden and the radical left have brought our nation to the brink of ruin. There�s never been anything like what has happened. After just nine months under Biden, violent criminals and blood thirsty gangs are taking over our streets, illegal aliens and deadly drug cartels are taking over our borders. Inflation is taking over our economy. China is taking over our jobs. The Taliban has taken over Afghanistan. Lunatic leftists are taking over our schools and radical socialists are taking over our country. And we�re not going to let that happen. We�re not going to let that happen. And you can�t say I didn�t warn you, but I also can�t say you didn�t get out because you got out and voted like no sitting president has ever received votes before. The election was rigged. But as disastrous as the Biden administration has been, no one can blame the great State of Iowa because, boy, we did really, we did really good here. Donald Trump: (02:24) Iowa, what a place? And by the way, nobody�s ever been better to Iowa and the farmers than Trump. I can tell you that. You know that. You know that. First you rejected Joe Biden by delivering him a humiliating fourth place finish in the Iowa caucuses. You remember that? He came out, he didn�t even stick around, he left. Then you came out in record numbers to give us thundering eight point landslide victory, a big beautiful victory in November. You proved why Iowa should continue to vote first in the nation. That�s right. First in the nation. And Jeff understands that. Right, Jeff? First in the nation, Jeff. And just this week, the latest the Boyne register poll showed that Biden is at a record low 31% approval in Iowa. Who the hell are the 31%? Is there anybody here that voted? Any 31 percenters? While your all time favorite president. This is a negative poll for Trump. I mean, they don�t like me too much but we can�t complain, I guess. Is that a record high we�re right now at a highest we�ve ever been, 53% approval. Which for radical left newspaper is not bad, right? You saw some of those polls. Texas is in play. We won by a lot. Florida is in play. We won by a lot. Ohio is in play. We won by a lot. He�s down 17 points in the state of Wisconsin and actually we won by a lot. Twice. Donald Trump: (04:26) Remember last time they had us down 19 points in Wisconsin and we won. I said, why is that? Why do they do that? Because they want to keep people from going and voting. It�s called suppression. They�re suppression polls, they should be illegal, but basically it�s the fake news. �Oh, you have a lot of people there.� Fake news. It�s the fake news. As we speak, Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats in Congress are trying to ramp through a $5 trillion world spending bills that cost more than the entire sum the United States has spent two on any war in the history of our country. Not only is this the largest spending bill of all time and the largest tax hike of all time, this monstrosity is so dangerous for our country and so bad for children and grandchildren to come. This monstrosity is a bill to end America as we know it. It�s so bad. And the Republicans have to stay strong. You have to stay strong. You have to fight. Bring our country back. Donald Trump: (05:37) It�s a socialist transformation bill. It�s an open borders bill. It�s an American energy destruction bill. First time ever we had energy independence ever. Now they�re calling OPEC, Russia and other countries, �Please send us some oil, will you please?� We were finished with that. We had more by far. When I left office, we had more energy, we had more coming in, we had more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia by far, than Russia by far and now what calling them asking if they�d help out. In Alaska they killed Anwar. They�ve been trying to get it since Ronald Reagan couldn�t get it. Couldn�t get it. And I got it. [inaudible 00:06:24]. Donald Trump: (06:27) For many, many years, for decades, and now perhaps the biggest drilling site anywhere in the world as big as Saudi Arabia, now you know what they did? They terminated it. Lisa Murkowski Republican did a really bad job for the state of Alaska. That I can tell you. It�s an illegal race-based discrimination bill. It�s a corrupt elections bill. Oh, wait till you look at what they have about your elections like the elections aren�t bad enough and corrupt enough. It�s a bankrupt Medicare bill. It�s a bankrupt social security bill. They�ll bankrupt both of them. And it�s a naked power grab by the likes of Biden and Pelosi and Kamala Harris. Hasn�t she done a great job with the border? Donald Trump: (07:14) And Bernie Sanders is in there too. And Omar. How about Omar? Omar. Omar is in there too. She doesn�t like Israel too much. Does she, huh? Didn�t she marry her brother, right? She came in she married her brother just nice. And they don�t do anything about it. They don�t do anything about it. With us they do everything, right? Oh, they do everything. Congressional Republicans must stand strong. This is not a time for Republicans to fall, to walk away, to quit, to be afraid. Whatever happens happens. They have to be strong. Don�t worry about being impeached. Don�t worry about anything. You�re worried one of them was so worried he was going to be impeached. He let everything happen. It was so sad to watch. I watched it. It was really pretty sad. But they just don�t seem to have the spine, some of them. Donald Trump: (08:18) Thank you. That was a great word. That�s the word I was looking for. You need spine. Here are just some of the ugly surprises hidden in the Democrats socialists calamity. According to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, the Biden spending bill will raise taxes on working families like never ever before. The Biden plan would make the United States business tax rate dramatically higher and bring it back to one of the highest in the world and actually substantially higher than a place called communist China. Have you ever heard of it? In fact, taking into account all taxes under Biden�s plan, the Democrat bill would give businesses an approximately 100% tax advantages to locate jobs in China rather than the United States. Think of it. Donald Trump: (09:21) We�re incentivizing people to go to China but not here. Gee, I wonder why. The Biden plan will build up China and the Republican party we want to build up America. Very simple. Biden socialists bill also includes mass amnesty and free college. Don�t get excited for illegal aliens. Not for you, but for illegal aliens. It includes a blow out increase in chain migration and it eliminates caps on green cards for foreign workers. Lots of luck. By the way, we have created more jobs than ever before. We have, we have 12 months ago, we had 160 million people working in this country. The highest number by far. African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, men, graduates of the top colleges and universities, non-graduates, people that didn�t have a high school education, never got a diploma, every single group had the highest numbers they�ve ever had. Hundreds of thousands of people are right now pouring into the United States from Haiti. The people coming into our country are uneducated. In many cases, don�t speak the language. They don�t have the skills that we need to make America great again. Have you ever heard that expression? And they�ve been for many, many years, sadly they�ve been unemployed. The Democrat bill will also admit every foreign national previously denied under my national security travel ban. Remember I had the travel ban? Everyone said, �Oh, what a horrible thing.� I said, �No, we really don�t want people in our country who are going to blow up our cities, if you don�t mind.� We don�t want. We don�t want fifth avenue blown up. They�re having enough time with crime on fifth avenue right now and Chicago and lots of other places. We won in the United States Supreme court for the travel ban, bringing in countless unscreened travelers from all over terror afflicted countries and they weren�t allowed to come in. We said we don�t, I�m sorry, we want to be politically correct. We want to be nice. I�m sorry. We don�t want people that want to hurt our people, that want to hurt our country. I think that�s okay. It will include funding for unlimited numbers of unvetted African nationals to be brought to America and given free welfare and government benefits courtesy of you, the people of Iowa and the American taxpayer. Congratulations. I�m sure you�re thrilled about it. As you have to struggle. And only 3% of the people they crammed into those planes, remember they said, � Oh, the airlift was� Oh, that was scrape.� They had no idea who was getting on those planes. We still don�t have any idea. Only 3% were qualified to be taken to a place called the United States of America. Isn�t that something? 3%. You�re going to be hearing from those people over the coming years in a very bad way, right? The Democrat package includes a plan to demolish the US energy industry which has largely been done in a period of nine months, starting with a $630 billion down payment on the socialist green new deal, which is throwing money out the window at the expense of future generations of Americans. The green new deal conceived and made up at about 15 minutes by some radicals sitting around in a room that know nothing about the environment. Donald Trump: (13:27) Their bill includes giant new taxes and fees and American oil. And especially on American gas production that will kill capitalists oil and gas jobs, devastating workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and many, many other states. Gas prices and inflation have already skyrocket. I saw the other day inflations are highest in 24 years. Think of it. But it�s going to go up and much more. Get ready. The Democrat bill imposes a new energy tax on methane which is projected to increase your energy costs by hundreds of dollars per year, percentages that nobody even knows what to say. Up 50, 60, 70, and 80% quickly. The bill abolishes the Hyde Amendment forcing taxpayers to fund the far left extreme abortion agenda, ripping babies from their mother�s womb right up until the moment of birth. And in fact killing babies even after birth. You saw that in Virginia with the governor of Virginia after birth. In the Republican party we believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Donald Trump: (14:55) The Democrat socialist bill also includes a $1.3 billion payoff to the fake news industry, these people, but we�re giving them money. They don�t deserve it. By subsidizing and hiring of reporters at media outlets all across the country, meaning, liberal media outlets. Can you imagine on top of everything else, billions of dollars is being spent to take care of these people that don�t report truth. They don�t report truth. They�re all going out, right now they�re going to buy a new car. Nice one too. Meanwhile, the media says nothing about Biden�s handling of COVID despite all of the vaccines that we came up with, therapeutics that we came up, and knowledge that we gave Biden�s come up with this horrible period of time. He hasn�t done the job because now we have more people that have died of COVID in 2021 with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, more people died in 2021 than in all of 2020. But the media is silent. They don�t talk about that. They hate to talk about that. Can you imagine if I were president and had these numbers and some people thought, first of all, he didn�t get elected. Okay. Forget that. But some people said, �Oh sir, it was COVID.� Donald Trump: (16:34) Incredible. They�re allowed to say that about me. They called it illegitimate, they called it everything in the book, it was fine when I say it. Now here�s the difference, Hillary conceded. I never conceded. Never. Never conceded. No reason to concede. When you look at the numbers of these swing states, and we�re going to go over them real quickly in a little while, but when you hear these numbers of swing states, there was no reason to concede. They shouldn�t have conceded. They did the honest thing, attacking our country. Even though the numbers are greater, they don�t have the death watch in the right hand corner. Remember on CNN fake news which is down 80% in ratings. Donald Trump: (17:24) Remember that death watch. Death watch. And the [inaudible 00:17:33], we don�t have that anymore, but they�re losing more people. Okay? What�s going on? That doesn�t sound so good. That�s because it�s fake news. They are the enemy of the people. The Democrat bill contains billions and billions of dollars for unlawful government training programs inspired by toxic and bigoted and critical race theory. It�s crammed with so-called equity provisions. Equity. You know what equity means? We�re going to take it away from you and give it to other people. I don�t think they�re going to take it away from too many of you. I have a feeling. I don�t think they�re going to take it away from you. But it�s a code word for illegal government discrimination that they want to bring to everything from education, to housing, to healthcare, to our military. Donald Trump: (18:26) They�re also giving the IRS the power to destroy people, just like they tried to do with the Tea Party, Christian organizations. And just like they�ve always been trying to do to me, yeah, you see that. We fight like hell. We all fight like hell. This bill is a sinister combination of job, killing tax hikes and walk fascism that will destroy our nation. And to think that we had 11 Republicans go along with an extension, headed up by Mitch McConnell. Can you believe that? Mitch McConnell. 11� And you know what it does? It gives the Democrats more time, two months. It gives them more time to figure it out. They can now have two more months to figure out how to screw us. That�s what they did. They approved it. And they should be ashamed of themselves. Donald Trump: (19:27) The radical Democrats will lower the final price tag to try to fool the public. They�ll come in and, �Oh, we don�t want the five.� Because it�s truly five, it�s not three and a half. Also, it�s not an infrastructure bill. It�s 9% infrastructure. The rest is a green new deal garbage that you might as well just throw it out, put it in the wastepaper basket. But think of it, trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars more than anybody�s ever even conceived of. Most of it for junk programs that will only hurt our country. Donald Trump: (20:02) But the bottom line will always be a socialist transformation of America if they allow this to happen. So when they talk about the debt ceiling, we have a very powerful card there. We don�t want to violate that, but that�s more important than what they�re going to do by passing this thing that�s going to kill our nation. All Americans have common sense. Republican, Democrat and independent must stand firm. And you have to really stand strong and firm against Biden, crazy Nancy Pelosi, she�s a nut job, and the extreme power grab. Donald Trump: (20:45) And we must declare with one united voice that we cannot allow America to ever become a socialist country. That�s what they�re doing. And I really think it�s a step beyond, I think this is going to be a communist country. We�re not letting it happen. But these people, the media who don�t cover anything they do that�s wrong, anything they do that�s okay they make it like it�s the greatest thing that ever happened, and anything we do that�s right they make it sound bad, evil and corrupt. They are sick people and they�re really hurting our country. Practically every single Democrat lawmaker, the house and Senate has endorsed this deranged legislation, and that�s why every single one of them has to be voted out of office next November. Next November, it�s coming up quick. Time flies, right? Time flies. Donald Trump: (21:41) Remember the election we said, �Oh boy, it will never end. It�s just it.� But let�s say, in November we have an election already. I mean, think of it. It�s a year from now we�re having an election so quickly it flies. The four years really flew. I did a couple of things. I said, I have two things. Number one is to protect and save our country. And the other thing was to survive against these maniacs. We must send the radical left a message. They will never, ever forget. And we must do it by electing record numbers of America first Republicans. And we have a lot of great ones. Donald Trump: (22:22) We have so many great ones. The Democrats multi-trillion dollar spending spree is also going to trigger runaway inflation. And last month we saw yet another dismal jobs report came out yesterday. Did you see those numbers? They were disaster. In fact, even the radical left newscast is oh, I think we�re looking at six or 700,000. What are you thinking about? I like 700,000. I think it�s 800,000. How about like really less than 200,000. They�re saying like, �Whoa, this has been.� And 10 minutes later, �Well, it�s not that bad actually, it�s pretty good.� These people are so corrupt. The media, look, I don�t need to do this. But the media is corrupt. And you know what? When I started, I�m so proud of this. Two things I proved. Number one, the elections are totally corrupt in our country. They have been for a long time. But never like they were this last time. They used COVID in order to cheat and rig. Donald Trump: (23:21) And the other thing is how dishonest the media was because they were at 96% approval rating before I came along, and now they�re like in what? The 20s. They�re actually, I think lower than Congress. Is that possible? Audience: (23:38) No. Donald Trump: (23:38) We�re going to witness a deadly combination of no growth and inflation, or what is known as stagflation. You remember stagflation from the years of Jimmy Carter. That�s very good. Well, let me show what you, oh. She�s a historian. Jimmy Carter, stagflation, they were not good years. I was in business. I was saying, �This isn�t good.� It was a bad time for our country, but this will be far worse because the numbers are far bigger. Under my administration we had the exact opposite. We had low inflation, surging growth, and the greatest jobs presidency in the history of our country. And I say that [inaudible 00:24:27]. Audience: (24:26) USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. Donald Trump: (24:52) I keep looking at these big, beautiful screens who else is going to give you a big screen like that? By the way, we have great generals but not the television guys. These guys are major losers. But do you think that general George Patton would have left early out of Afghanistan? Do you think he would have left dead soldiers for no reason whatsoever? And do you think he would have left $85 billion worth of the best equipment anywhere in the world? And you know Russia and China, they already have samples of our great helicopters. We have the Apache helicopter. We have the best stuff in the world, and they are now re-engineering the equipment, they�re de engineering, they�re taking it apart, they�re figuring it out and very soon they�ll be building the best stuff for less money. It�s a disgrace. What�s happened is a disgrace. Think of it. 600,000 of the best machine guns, rifles, and guns made anywhere in the world. And I read the other day, these tremendous numbers- Donald Trump: (26:03) And I read the other day, there�s tremendous numbers of our equipment right now, being sold on the black market. Isn�t that nice? General George Patton � I saw that movie years ago. And a little while ago, we were at a rally, and it was a great rally. And I said, �Could you guys ever find that opening to George Patton?� Right? What a great thing that was. George C. Scott, George C. Scott. I don�t know. Did he win the Academy Award? Did the movie? I think so. Something like that. They did pretty well. Right? But that was him. In fact, they actually said that wasn�t nearly as tough as the real Patton. That was a softer version of the real Patton, but we need that. We did great. We knocked out a 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Donald Trump: (26:50) We had great generals. We had a general named Cain. I went to Iraq. I don�t want to embarrass him, because he�s not a television general. I�ll end up ruining him. He�ll probably come out with a bad statement about me, because he was told to. But we had a general. I flew in, and I landed at night. Every window was dark, because they thought it would be � This is on Air Force One. I said, �Isn�t that terrible?� The lights were all off. They pulled down the shades. The plane was entirely black. They couldn�t see it. And I said, �Isn�t that incredible? We�ve spent trillions of dollars in the Middle East, and we can�t even land Air Force One with the lights on.� But I landed. And it was an incredible experience. I got to meet a lot of great real people, real soldiers, real generals, real officers. We have great generals. Donald Trump: (27:40) And I said to them � They greeted me at the airplane, immediately whisked me inside. I�m saying, �You mean with all the money we spent � � But I met two generals that could star in any movie. They had that quality. And the sergeant, who was unbelievable, could have been a movie star. I said, �You�re a good looking guy. You�re a tough guy.� �Yes, sir.� But I met general � I said, �General Cain, what�s your first name?� �Raisin, sir. Raisin.� I said, �You mean like a raisin?� �Yes, sir.� I said, �You mean, your name is general Raisin Cain? I love you, general. You�re what I�m looking for. I�m looking for that.� And I said, �So, general, they say it�s going to take two years, general, to get rid of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq, Syria. And do you agree with that?� �No, sir.� I said, �You don�t? Well, my Washington television general said two years, and they said we won�t be able to do it in the � � �I disagree, sir.� Donald Trump: (28:46) I said, �How long will it take?� �Sir, we can do it in four weeks. Maybe less, sir.� I said, �Wait a minute, general, explain this to me.� �Well, sir, they would come here and there of a higher rank.� I said, �Did you ever tell them what you have in mind?� �No, sir. That wasn�t my job. I�m a general. I was at a lower rank. They tell me, sir. They didn�t ask. I�m not supposed to do that, sir. I�d like to, and I wanted to, but I couldn�t.� Donald Trump: (29:14) I said, �So you did a plan that they didn�t want. Right? That�s what you want to do now.� He said, �Yes, sir. It�s very easy.� I said, �When you say four weeks,� Said, �Yes, sir, four weeks. And you know what? We�re going to have time left over, sir.� I said, �So what�s different? They say two years, and you won�t do it. You say four weeks, and you�re going to have time left over. What�s the difference?� �Sir, we�d hit them from five different locations. We�ll hit him from the left. We�ll hit him from the right. We�ll hit him down the middle. We�ll be launching from Syria, from Iraq and from all over. Sir, they only wanted us to fly from this big air force base that we have right here, from our big base. And we�re very far away, and it�s one location. Sir, we have many locations and we�ll hit them from every damn one of those locations.� Donald Trump: (30:08) And you know what? I said, �Well, let me give that a little thought, general.� I went back, and I listened to the other ones. And I said, �They�re not good.� One of them, Milley, actually told me that when we leave, he � I know where this came from. He went to Biden. I know exactly where this came from, because he told me the same thing, Milley, a real genius. I put the Patton thing up. Compare that to Milley. But he said to me the same thing as they did, �Sir, it�s cheaper to leave the equipment than it is to take it.� I said, �Now wait a minute,� and especially being in the construction business, right? I said, �So you mean we have a $50 million plane?� All it needs is a tank of gas and a pilot. Donald Trump: (30:52) We could have flown over 200 pilots, taken everything out. But we didn�t have to worry, because the Taliban listened to me. We didn�t have one soldier killed, think of it, in 18 months. I spoke to Abdul. Abdul is the man running the Taliban right now. They left us alone. And it would�ve been fine, but what happened is we took all our soldiers out. And I told this one time before to our great group of people, very much like you, from a slightly different state. Remember, Biden went to say, �It�s great to be in Idaho.� They said, �Sir, you�re in Iowa.� Do you remember that? � It�s wonderful to be in New Hampshire.� �Sir. You�re in Florida.� So we should have known. Donald Trump: (31:36) But I know exactly what happened. Milley went up to him, just like he did to me. But it was unacceptable. With me, �I said, I want every nut. I want every bolt. I want every screw. I want every plane and tank. I want the Apaches. I want everything out. And I even want the hangers.� Those beautiful canvas hangers that hold these big monster planes. They�re massive. I said, �I want the hangers. I want the canvas. I want the plastic. I want the fiberglass. And I want the steel. I want everything out. And then we�re going to bomb the hell out of the five or so bases that we don�t want.� Donald Trump: (32:12) And with Bagram, I hate to say it, but we�re going to keep. We�re going to stay there. It�s right next to China. Nice to have a base like that. It�s got the longest runway there is. The concrete pad is so thick. I couldn�t [inaudible 00:32:26] in construction. I figured maybe six inches. How about six-feet? Six-feet thick. And we left it. They spent supposedly $10 billion, building. And we left it in one night, and we left all the equipment. And don�t believe them when they say they disabled the equipment. They didn�t. You see a couple of helicopters. They didn�t disable. They got killed for leaving the equipment. And so they disabled a couple of little old helicopters. That equipment is brand new, right out of a box, including the night goggles, which are better than the goggles we have. They�re later models. And including all of the rifles, machine guns and guns, they�re the latest model, the latest and the greatest. Donald Trump: (33:03) So our enemy of many years has all of that. And it�s a shame. It�s a shame to see what�s happened to our country. It�s a shame, but the general was great. So he called me up. I said, �General, give it to me one more time.� �Four weeks, sir.� I said, �General, go ahead.� �Thank you, sir, very much.� Now he doesn�t give a shit about television. He�s a general. Generals aren�t supposed to care about them. Remember this, just to go back for a second. So when Milley told me that, I said, �What are you a nut job? Are you stupid?� That�s when I realized � That was one of the many times I realized he was stupid. Such a phony story they concocted, but one of the many times. But you know what I realized? He went in to Biden and said the same thing. �Sir, it�s cheaper to leave the equipment than it is to take it.� You�ll have a $5 million army tank. You�ll have a $30 million helicopter, brand new. Think of this. Even if you just flew it into Pakistan, it�s a very short flight. And then you took your time and taken it. We should have taken everything. Most importantly, we should have never lost 13 warriors. And nobody talks about this, and we should talk about it every time, every time. Donald Trump: (34:22) We also have numerous young people who have lost a leg, lost an arm, in one case, lost two legs and an arm. And nobody talks. We talk about the 13, and we love those 13. And they�re looking down on us right now. And they�re proud of us, because we what we�re doing. But we had some terribly wounded people. And overall, they lost approximately 250 people. That�s a terrible thing. Should�ve never happened. Should have never happened in that location. Should have happened in Bagram, where you have a big, big wall actually, a wall. You�re not allowed to say wall. They don�t like walls. The Democrats don�t want to build a wall. It was almost completed. I had to start it two-and-a-half years later for one reason, I had to fight off all the lawsuits where they were suing me. And it was just about finished. They would�ve finished the wall. Donald Trump: (35:14) But what happened with the general, Raisin Cain, is called me up, said, �Sir, it�s done.� I said, �Done?� �It�s done, sir. And we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in record time. Sir, we hit them so hard. They didn�t know what the hell was happening, sir.� We defeated � We do. We have great generals. We have great soldiers and sailors and everything. I�m so proud of it and so proud of Space Force. Remember, they didn�t like Space Force. Donald Trump: (35:49) Space Force going to be one of our most important. We totally rebuilt the military, but we did this. And that was much tougher than withdrawing from Afghanistan, which we wanted to do, we wanted to do. And by the way, speaking of Pakistan, Pakistan would�ve helped us, but we didn�t ask them for the help. We give billions and billions of dollars a year to Pakistan, and they don�t do anything for us. They don�t do anything. They would�ve helped if we did it the right way, so that�s what happened. But we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Think of that. And we knocked out Soleimani, and we knocked al-Baghdadi. Donald Trump: (36:37) They didn�t know what the hell happened. And I�ll tell you what, our country was respected again. This would�ve never happened, taking the military out first. And I told this, I said, �Look, Abdul, Abdul, the American soldiers have left.� And he said � I�m doing this like [Schiff 00:37:02] did to me, with a phone call that he made up. Right? But mine is probably totally true. And Abdul, the leader of the Taliban, good fighters, by the way, he said, �You�re crazy. They didn�t leave. Are you crazy? Get him out of here. He�s crazy.� �Sir, they left.� �No, they didn�t.� �They left, sir.� And then they sent a patrol in, call back. They said, �Sir, the Americans have left.� He said, �I don�t believe it.� And then they just walked into Kabul, and they walked into the remaining portions of Afghanistan. They didn�t do that with me. Donald Trump: (37:38) They didn�t do that with me. They respected us. Remember this. Again, we had conditions. They weren�t meeting them, we�d hit them hard. They would�ve met every one of those conditions. But remember the first condition was you can�t kill Americans, and you can�t shoot, kill American soldiers. Not one soldier was killed in 18 months. Not one. Think of that. And remember when Biden was making the speech about three weeks ago, and it was a disaster for him, and he was in the middle of a disaster, but he�s protected by the press. They don�t even talk about Afghanistan anymore. They don�t even talk about it. But you remember when he was making this speech, he said, �Well, I will say that in 18 months, we�ve lost no soldiers.� And his people are screaming at him, �Don�t. Stop there. Why did you bring that up? That�s a good thing for Trump.� Donald Trump: (38:28) I kept waiting for the, but. There was no, but. We lost no soldiers for 18 months, because Abdul knew that we were going to hit them harder than any country has ever been hit before. Okay. It�s very simple. And he understood that. He understood that. No, it�s a very sad thing that happened. I think to me, Afghanistan is the most embarrassing event in the history of our country. I do think that, and I think that meaning the withdrawal. We went in there, we didn�t fight like we should have. We became a police force instead of the military, as we know it. And just, they didn�t fight. But you know what? They should have. They did what they did, but to leave in disgrace, instead of leaving the way they should have left. Donald Trump: (39:14) When I left office, we handed Biden the most secure border in United States history. And that includes from drugs, not just people. We ended catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central American nations to stop illegal immigration. And we built almost 500 miles of powerful border wall, which really helped us. And I want to thank the president of Mexico, great guy. I said, �You have to put your soldiers until we build the wall. You got to put your soldiers. How many do you need? 28,000.� It�s a long wall. That�s a long border. And he did it. He gave us 28,000 soldiers. And that�s why we did things that nobody else could do. Donald Trump: (40:04) Now, in all fairness, he did it for a reason. I said, �If you don�t do it, we�re going to put a 25% tariff on all the cars that you make and sell it back into the � � And they said, �Yes, we�d love to do it. It would be our honor.� Whatever it is, it worked. Donald Trump: (40:20) And we have a great relationship with him and with Mexico, and it worked out great. And then these people came, and they tore down everything. Remain in Mexico, gone. All of it�s gone. And people are destroying our country. We tracked down the gang members, the drug smugglers and the dangerous criminal aliens. And we threw them in jail, or we threw them the hell out of our country. Ideally, we wanted to get them out. But some were so dangerous, we put them in jail. Yet Biden has systematically reversed every border security policy that we had in place. Oh, they were so good. Donald Trump: (40:52) I say, and I mean it, if Biden, would�ve just gone to the beach, just take it easy, enjoy the surf, you�d have a great border today, because it was getting better and better and better. And you hear all the border patrol people, even people that worked for him, they�re saying we should have left it. They didn�t have to do anything. It was so good. Best we�ve ever had. And people could come in, but they have to come in legally. Donald Trump: (41:16) Just days ago, even amid the worst border crisis in history, the Biden administration issued an order, effectively abolishing ICE. These are great patriots. These are tough people. They would go into these gangs of MS-13, the toughest gangs in the world, they say, and they�d go in there and the fist would start � I�d say these people. And I can tell you, I have some tough people in front of me. Some of them are even tough farmers. I don�t even think you people want to do what they do. And they loved it. They wouldn�t want any other job. And they�re great patriots. They love our country, but they were tough, to get rid of MS-13 and some of the worst people that you�ve ever seen. Donald Trump: (41:57) I mean, typically when you have tattoos on your face, it�s not a positive event. It�s not positive. When you have a tattoo on your face saying, �We hate America.� And we say, �We�d love to have you.� It�s great. It�s not going to work out well. But when you look at what they�ve done, ICE has been so incredible. And they�ve basically taken away their power and their prestige, but they will be around because nobody can do the job that they did. And that goes for the border patrol and our police department and law enforcement. Donald Trump: (42:27) Our police departments are incredible and law enforcement, incredible. I met a lot of them backstage. You have them here, incredible police. And with the Republicans, there�ll be no defunding of the police. I can tell you that. There�ll be no defunding. That�s not working out too well. You see in Minnesota, Minneapolis there, they�re not doing too well. They defunded the police and they cut it. And it�s a disaster. Crime is through the roof, but it is in other places. New York is through the roof. You have district attorneys. They�re looking at Republicans. They�re not looking at people that shoot people every day. It�s a crazy � Donald Trump: (43:08) What�s happening is so bad for this country, so dangerous for this country. People want other people to stop shooting and knifing people to death in broad daylight. Did you see the case in Chicago? Gets out of the car, starts shooting somebody, and they just said, �We�re not going to press charges.� And he�s right on tape and right on camera. No, it�s a terrible thing that�s happening. It�s sick. Actually, it�s sick. And it�s only going to lead to the destruction of our country. And other bad things can happen, because I don�t think a lot of people are going to take it for much longer. I�ll be honest. I don�t think they�re going to take it. Donald Trump: (43:44) Other countries are emptying their prisons and sending their murderers and drug smugglers and child abusers into the United States. We are becoming a dumping ground. We are a dumping ground for very, very serious criminals. And Joe, you know that. You know, I used to say, it�s in Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador, but it�s not. It�s in many, many countries, many, many, including Middle Eastern countries. They�re taking them out of prison. These are seriously tough people, evil people in many cases. And they�re dumping them in the � We�re becoming a dumping ground. Never before has a president shown such contempt for oath of office. He�s supposed to be protecting our country, not destroying our country. Donald Trump: (44:33) Joe Biden has launched a foreign invasion of his own country. Come on in. He said, �Come in.� This is a sick thing that�s happening to our country. Not even explainable. I used to say it was incompetence, but it is that. But you know what it really is? I don�t know. It�s almost like evil. They want this to happen, because they�re paying $6 million a day to contractors to not finish the wall, which could be finished very rapidly. They�re paying millions of dollars a day to contractors. And do I know tractors. They�re making a fortune. They�re making more money now than they would ever make if they built it. But they�re paying millions and millions of dollars a day, a week, a month to these contractors not to build the wall. And you wonder, is that incompetence, or is that just a bad ideology? You know? It�s probably a lot of both. Donald Trump: (45:32) Biden had the gall to attack our brave border agents in the midst of this nightmarish disaster. And remember the horses, these guys with the horses, to keep illegal immigrants out of our country, or to keep them at bay. And now they�re fighting for their lives, those people. And it wasn�t a whip by the way. They didn�t have whips. They didn�t have whips. What a sad thing is going on. Donald Trump: (45:59) In the Republican party, we will always stand with law enforcement and our great heroes of law enforcement. And we will keep America safe. All of these calamities are the direct, predictable and disastrous consequence of a totally corrupt election. It�s all because of the corrupt election. They rigged the election. And now based on the rigged election, they�re destroying our country. That�s not a mandate. That�s a destruction of our country. Remember this, it�s not about me being robbed of an election. This is about the American people, having their country taken away from them. That�s what it�s really about. Donald Trump: (46:47) Just recently, we got the results of the Arizona forensic audit, but the papers refused to report it the way it was, which showed massive irregularities, to put it nicely. That�s a nice word. A few in the findings, 23,344 mail-in ballots came from people who no longer lived at that address. Oh, that�s wonderful. The entire margin in the state, remember, or as they say, lost. We didn�t lose. But the number they concocted was 10,457. That�s what I lost by 10,000 votes. A little more than 10,000. There was no chain of custody, which you have to have provided for. Listen to this, no chain of custody for 1.9 million mail-in ballots. Now think of that. We need 10,000. There�s no chain of custody for 1.9 million. There were 2,500 duplicated ballots with no serial numbers. Oh, they have to have a serial number. What happened to the serial number? Donald Trump: (47:55) There was also missing serial numbers on thousands and thousands of adjudicated ballots. At least 1,900 blank mail-in ballot envelopes were discovered. Well, it�s not supposed to be blank. There were numerous bad signatures or mail-in ballot envelopes that should not have been counted. These are all things that they have. 2,081 votes were cast by people who had moved out of the state. Oh, that�s wonderful. But we�re talking about Arizona. You�re supposed to live in Arizona. 10, 324 voters might have voted in multiple counties. Oh, well, that�s okay. I vote here. Let�s vote in another county, maybe two or three or four. 284,412 ballot images were quote, corrupt, they quoted, corrupt or missing. Oh, but I only lost by a little more than 10,000 votes. In addition, the auditors discovered that millions of the election related files, the files were deleted during and after the election, in violation of federal law, including a purge of the election management system software the day before the audit began. Oh, I see. Donald Trump: (49:17) And the Justice Department was scared or impotent. They didn�t want to do anything about it. It�s been going on for years, but never like this. Again, they used COVID in order to cheat, with all of these ballots and all of this early voting and late voting. Likewise, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case by Texas and almost 20 other states. And now their approval rating is the lowest it�s been in memory. They have the lowest approval rating in memory. And I believe it�s for the reason that they refused or didn�t have the courage. They rule against me all the time, all the time, very personal rulings. They didn�t have the courage to do something about the election. And I believe that�s the real reason their ratings or their approval numbers are so low. Donald Trump: (50:09) These horrific findings are now in the hands of the Arizona attorney general. And let�s hope that he does the right thing for our country. I don�t know that he will, I don�t know that he will, but let�s hope he does. Our country needs it, Arizona needs it. And with all of those numbers being so horrible- Audience: (50:29) Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won. Donald Trump: (50:36) We did. Audience: (50:36) Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won. Donald Trump: (50:36) We did. Audience: (50:36) Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won. Donald Trump: (50:48) Thank you. Very, very sad for our country. The whole world laughs at us on this too, this, the border, Afghanistan. But with all of those numbers being so horrible, Arizona was in my opinion, the least corrupt of the other swing states. I think it was the least corrupt. It was so corrupt. They used the word �determinative�. That means are there enough votes? Like for instance, if you had 300 dead people voting, but you needed 10,000 votes, I wouldn�t even talk about that. But we have a determinative result many, many times over, so many times over, otherwise I wouldn�t bring it up. It was recently reported that 43,000 absentee ballot votes were counted in DeKalb County, Georgia, that violated the chain of custody rules, 43,000. Georgia was decided by only 11,779 votes. In other words, I needed 11,779 votes, and they have 40,000 here and 20,000 here. There were many other infractions in Georgia, but the Secretary of State, Raffensperger, and the governor of � Donald Trump: (52:03) Secretary of State, Raffensperger, and the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, who I got elected by giving him an endorsement. Thank you very much for that recommendation to endorse this guy, absolutely refused to do anything about it. He hurt our Party and he hurt our country very badly. Kemp was in last place when I endorsed him, and he ended up winning because of my endorsement in a landslide. He�s afraid of Stacey Abrams. I don�t know what the hell that she�s got, but he and the Republicans, but he is afraid of Stacey Abrams and refuses to take on the corrupt Democrats in the State of Georgia, just refuses. I know, it�s fraught with danger. It�s fraught with danger, but you have to do it. It�s for the country. Donald Trump: (52:53) But think of this. I win Alabama. I love Alabama. I win Alabama by a record vote, a record. I win South Carolina by a record vote, but right next to them is Georgia and I lose by that much, it doesn�t work that way. A new investigation by True the Vote alleges a gigantic illegal ballot harvesting operation, involving large numbers of people throughout the State of Georgia and many other places. Donald Trump: (53:24) Why aren�t they investigating the stuff? They are not investigating it. Jody Hice will end up taking over that job and he�ll investigate. Congressman Jody Hice gave up his absolutely guaranteed seat because he saw what was happening, how corrupt it is in Georgia. Also in Georgia, everybody�s heard the water main break story, right? Where people were rushed out of the Vote Tabulation Room because of a water main break. Donald Trump: (53:51) �There�s a water main break, everybody leave.� They all ran out, but there was no water main break. Only to see a crew of Democrat operatives, or whoever, come back and start pouring votes into machines from boxes that mysteriously appeared from under a table, from under a table. Donald Trump: (54:14) And the Governor found nothing wrong with that, and the Justice Department found nothing wrong with that. And it�s on tape, and it�s like baseball now and football. They do action replays in magnified [inaudible 00:54:27]. They have a fashionable, magnified tape and you can see just about everything. It�s a sad thing. I think they have cases where they had the same one, three times, four times, five times, but that was all a fake story. There was no water main break. Donald Trump: (54:46) And then they actually said, �No, the water main break took place 250 miles away,� somebody said. I don�t know if that�s correct or not, but they were looking all over the place for a water main, that didn�t work out too well. So Georgia is very, very sad, and the law they pass isn�t tough enough, by the way. They weakened it because Stacy Abrams wanted it weakened. She wanted it weakened and they do whatever she says. Pretty amazing. I don�t know. Hey, maybe she�ll be running for President, I�d like that. Let�s run against Stacey Abrams, I�d like that. Donald Trump: (55:18) In Pennsylvania, they were reportedly hundreds of thousands of more votes than there were voters, oh, I see. Philadelphia, more votes than voters. That�s a tough one to explain. Why didn�t they do something about that? Hopefully the people of Pennsylvania are angry that this can be allowed to happen, and will not allow the Republican majority to be re-elected if they don�t get to the bottom of it fast, but there�s no getting to the bottom. We won the State. Donald Trump: (55:51) I was up by massive numbers on election day. Even the news was saying, �Wow, what a big lead in Pennsylvania.� I love Pennsylvania, I went to school in Pennsylvania College, but what a great State and what great people, and I was up by so much, all of a sudden the booths closed, the Tabulation Centers are closed, three o�clock in the morning. And shortly thereafter, we�re tied and then we�re losing by just a little bit. We�re just losing by just a little bit. No, it�s a disgrace. And the US Attorney said that he was told by the Attorney General not to do anything. The US Attorney was a pretty tough guy. He was told not to do anything by the Attorney General because the Attorney General, I think didn�t want to have problems. He was very worried about certain things with regard to himself, and I think it was probably the easy way out, but so bad for our country. The US Attorney of Philadelphia, in the Philadelphia area said, �I was told�� In writing, said, �I was told not to do anything, not to pursue it.� Donald Trump: (57:01) And Philadelphia was so corrupt. Pittsburgh was very corrupt, they say, but think of it, more votes than you had voters. That�s a pretty easy one. We don�t have to go into a lot of detail. That�s a pretty easy one. In Pennsylvania, thousands of voters reported receiving at least two ballots in the mail, and many others reported receiving mail-in ballots without requesting them. They just happened to flow in, they flowed in. Donald Trump: (57:27) On election day, thousands of people were complaining that they weren�t allowed to vote because they were told that their ballot had already been cast. How many people� Here in Iowa, you had a good clean� You have a great Governor. You had a clean� Who happens to be here. Where is she? Where�s your Governor? Stand up. Stand up, Kim. Great Governor. I�ll be introducing you. I�ll be introducing [inaudible 00:57:50]. But no, she did a great job. Donald Trump: (57:54) Kim, if you had more votes than you had voters, would that bother you? When they say, �Sir, you have more votes than voters,� and they don�t want to do anything about it. They complained vehemently, some laughed in disgust. Think of it. People walk in and they�re proud. And the Republicans tend to vote on election day, and the Democrats tend to use ballots, right? Maybe they�re better off using ballots, the way it happened, because it was a shocker. Donald Trump: (58:20) But people would walk in and they were proud people. They don�t want anybody playing with the ballots. They don�t want anything to go wrong. �So I�m going to vote on election day.� They get up and they get out, and they vote, and they go and they say, �I�d like to vote.� �I�m sorry ma�am, you�ve already voted.� �I haven�t voted. I just came here.� �No, no, ma�am, I�m sorry, you voted.� This happened by the thousands and thousands. Donald Trump: (58:50) And you know what? Some would walk out laughing in disgust. Some walked out crying. So many complaints. It�s such a disgrace. There�s never been anything like this ever happened in our country before, and I think everybody has a good idea who got those votes. You ever see some of those so-called lockboxes? I call them unlocked boxes. Donald Trump: (59:19) 97% of the vote goes to sleepy Joe Biden, 97. I said, �I did really well in that State. I don�t think I only got 3%. You�ve got to look at those boxes. You have to look at the tabulation, at the numbers, the unlocked boxes.� In Michigan, the legislature found that over 300,000 people were listed on the voter rolls, even though they hadn�t voted in over 20 years. Oh, and again, in Detroit, which is known as the single most corrupt election venue in the country for many years, but nobody went to look at that, there were many more votes than there were voters. Donald Trump: (01:00:04) And if you saw the percentage of errors on the vote, it was almost infinite decimal, where even four years ago, when you didn�t have all the mail-in ballot and all of the� It wasn�t like it was this time. They had 4%. This year we had none, with mail-in ballots, they had almost nothing. And then I have to listen to people and they say, �There was no fraud, there was no fraud.� Donald Trump: (01:00:31) Over 40 years, bellwether Counties have correctly predicted every election. Bellwether Counties, it�s a big deal. I won almost every bellwether County, more than any other President. I won 18 out of 19. No President has ever done that, 18 out of 19. If you got just a small number, you win. I won 18 out of 19, the most any President�s ever won. Donald Trump: (01:01:02) Think of it, we won 27 out of 27 toss-up House races. We won all 27. So they like to say, �Well, the people in the House were more popular than Trump.� No, I made robocalls for them. I made calls for them. I helped them, and some of them said to me, a lot of them said, �It�s impossible. We got X percentage of vote. I got more than you, but you were much more popular in my District than I was.� Donald Trump: (01:01:29) It�s amazing. That�s what happened to our country. I had numerous calls from people saying, �Sir, it�s not possible that I beat you. Every poll, every� There was no way that I beat you. This election was rigged.� They said that. �This election was rigged.� And no Presidential candidate has ever lost an election while winning Florida, Ohio, and a place called Iowa. First time it�s ever happened. So think of it, think of it. Think of it, in the history of our country, if you win Iowa, Florida, and Ohio, no President has ever� If you win that, you don�t lose, never happened. All these elections, so many years, never happened. Thank you very much, Iowa. We love you. Thank you. Joe Biden lost with the African American population to former President, Barack Hussein Obama in every single State, other than the five swing States. In other words, the only States that were going to determine the election, although I think a lot of other States were corrupt also, but the only swing States, the swing States that determined, that�s where Biden won with the African American population. Donald Trump: (01:02:59) I don�t think so. No, I don�t think so. I don�t believe that. In other words, the election was a fraud and if we want to save our country and make America great again, we have only one choice. We must elect strong and unyielding America first Republicans at every level, and we must pass a complete overhaul of our entire election system to ensure it�s free, fair, honest, and able to be fully and quickly audited. I tell a lot of these Republicans in Congress and all, they don�t want to get involved. And I say� Go ahead, let�s go. Go! [crosstalk 01:03:47] Donald Trump: (01:03:48) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support. You�ve been incredible. Iowa has been incredible, but I tell a lot of these Republicans, some rhinos, but people that do like us, people that love the country, �Sir, think to the future. You shouldn�t go back to the past. You have to think.� I say, �I�ve been doing this stuff a long time now, not as long as [inaudible 01:04:18], but for a long time. And I�m telling you, the single biggest issue, as bad as the border is, it�s horrible, horrible what they�re doing. They�re destroying our country. As bad as that is, the single biggest issue, the issue that gets the most pull, the most respect, the biggest cheers is talking about the election fraud of 2020 Presidential election. Nobody�s ever seen anything like it.� Donald Trump: (01:04:45) And these guys will say� And they mean it. You have some bad guys and then you have the Democrats. They don�t want to be caught. A lot of the steal, a lot of what they do is they don�t want to talk about it because they know we�re so close. They don�t want to talk. And when they say cancel and cancel culture, you know why it�s canceled? It�s not canceled for any other reason. It�s canceled because they don�t want anyone talking about the election. Donald Trump: (01:05:09) They don�t write about it. I�ll bet you, their damn cameras went off. They don�t talk about it. They don�t write about it because they know they got caught. They know they got caught. All you have to do is listen to the numbers. And remember what I said, Arizona was more honest than the other States, in my opinion, much more honest than some of them. But the single biggest topic that they want, people that love our country, because they said, �If you don�t solve this, people aren�t going to vote in �22 and �24. They don�t want to go through this again.� Donald Trump: (01:05:47) When we have numbers, when I go to Arizona or Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, Butler, Pennsylvania, I had 58,000 people show up in a small town in the middle of Pennsylvania, just before the vote. And I said, �It�s not possible to lose this. That�s like the ultimate poll.� He would go there and he�d have eight circles and he couldn�t fill them, so the press would stand there. They couldn�t fill eight circles. We had 58,000 people. Donald Trump: (01:06:13) I go to Arizona. I went twice. We had 38,000, 42,000, I think maybe even a third time, well over 40,000 and I laughed. I said, �Not possible to lose.� And then all of a sudden, you lose just by a whisper. Now, fraudulent numbers shouldn�t take months to accumulate with Democrats and rhino Republicans in the way of every single step we take, they�re in the way. We got them by surprise. Donald Trump: (01:06:44) We all got them by surprise in 2016 and they said, �We�ll never let this happen again.� They worked hard for four years and yet we did far better in 2020 than we did in 2016. It was a rigged election. It�s very interesting, a reporter from one of the people, sending back that big one, on the liberal side said, �What was the difference between 2020 and 2016?� I said, �Well, the primary difference was I did much better in 2020 than I did in 2016. The rallies were bigger. The enthusiasm was even greater, if that�s possible. And we got far more votes, almost 75,000,000 votes, more than any sitting President has ever gotten.� Last time we got 63,000,000. We got 12,000,000 more votes. No President in history has ever gotten that many more votes from the time before, not even close. So we got 63,000,000 in 2016. I was told by the best pollster, supposedly the best pollster. I won�t use his name because you have other good pollsters, but you have mostly, really bad pollsters, evil pollsters, crooked pollsters. But they came to me and they said, �Sir, you got 63,000,000 votes. If you get 64,000,000 votes, you can�t lose. If you get 65,000,000 it�s over, sir.� I got almost 75,000,000, probably I got 85,000,000 but who the hell knows? Donald Trump: (01:08:14) And we lost, they say, and our country�s paying a very big price as everybody knows. And by the way, you know who was one of our best supporters in Congress? A guy named Chuck Grassley, one of our best supporters on election fraud. He was one of our best supporters, and I�m going to introduce him in a second because I have something very important to say about him, but he was one� He�d write these letters, and when Chuck speaks, �Were you lying? Did you leak?� And he�s actually trying to be nice, but the voice is so tough. He scares the hell� Remember he scared the hell out of Komie? �Did you leak?� �Yes, I�m sorry,� like Perry Mason. Donald Trump: (01:08:54) As everybody here knows, my new slogan was going to be Make America� Remember this, remember? It was supposed to be something a little different than Make America Great. It was supposed to be Keep America Great, but America�s not great right now. So we�re using the same slogan, Make America Great Again. And we may even add to it, but we�ll keep it, Make America Great Again, Again, because we already did it, right? We�re going to make America great again, again. Donald Trump: (01:09:29) No, I had a whole big deal and it was all good, and it was just going to be Keep America Great because we made it great. Our military was rebuilt, our economy was great. Our job numbers were the best. We had the best country we�ve ever had, and in nine months, little more, they�ve destroyed our country. So I can�t say Keep America Great. So I�m back to Make America Great Again-/, Again. Make America Great Again, Again. I don�t know, what do you like better? Really, if you think about it, it�s more accurate. Make America Great Again, Again, because we made it great. Now we have to make it great again. So it�s one of those things, but Make America Great Again, our nation�s comeback begins in November 2022, when we�re going to reclaim the House, and we�re going to reclaim the United States Senate. Donald Trump: (01:10:34) And we have with us tonight, a great American patriot, a man who truly loves Iowa, loves Iowa. He�s young, very young guy. He�s strong and he�s very handsome. He fights like no other. When I�ve needed him for help, he was always there, especially with anything having to do with farmers, and that includes ethanol. Nobody�s ever done more. I know more about ethanol than anybody in the audience, I think. Donald Trump: (01:11:10) He was with us all the way. Every time I needed something, he�s very persnickety sometimes, right? He�s tough. But when I needed him, he was always there. And I just want to ask Senator Chuck Grassley just to come up for a second. Chuck Grassley, strong on military, strong on Vets, strong on our under siege Second Amendment. He helped pass the USMCA, helped confirm almost 300 Federal Judges and three great Supreme court Justices. Donald Trump: (01:11:46) Come here. You are the greatest. Look at this, he�s young. I�m thrilled to announce tonight that Senator Chuck Grassley has my complete and total endorsement for re-election. Chuck? [crosstalk 01:12:02]. Chuck Grassley: (01:12:14) I was born at night, but not last night. So if I didn�t accept the endorsement of a person that�s got 91% of the Republican voters in Iowa, I wouldn�t be too smart. I�m smart enough to accept that endorsement. [crosstalk 01:12:33] Donald Trump: (01:12:39) He�s a great guy. He is a great gentlemen. I think he�s never missed a vote, can you believe it? After so many decades, you�re lucky to have him. We�re also delighted to be joined by your Governor, Kim Reynolds. I�ve gotten to know her so well. She�s so tough. She�s so tough. Kim, great job. Donald Trump: (01:13:08) I said, �Kim, do you want me to endorse you tonight or later?� She said, �Sir, this is Chuck Grassley�s night.� How nice is that? �So if you would, give it to me sometime in the very near future, if you don�t mind.� I thought that was very nice Kim, most people wouldn�t say that. They�d say, �Give it to me now,� but she�s been an incredible Governor, done a great job. Loves our farmers, our people, loves everybody. Respected, and she�s had some tough races and she always comes out on top. She�s smarter and she�s tougher. So I�ll be talking to you soon about it, endorsement Kim. I refuse to do it now, Kim, okay? Donald Trump: (01:13:52) Members of Congress, they�ve been incredible, highly respected. Ashley Hinson, Ashley, Ashley. Great job. Great job, Ashley. And Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Mariannette, thank you. Proud of them. By the way, we have a man. We talk about strong people and weak people. We talk about stupid people and smart people, but we have a man from Arizona with us tonight. He is tough as hell. He�s incredible, and he is running for a certain position that�s going to be, I think a very easy victory. Arizona State Representative, Mark Finchem is with us tonight, and what a job he�s done. Mark, great job Mark. You�re going to win big, Mark. Because he�s tough, they say he�s controversial. It�s not controversial. He�s actually not controversial. Donald Trump: (01:14:50) A man that I�ve gotten to know over a five-year period, a man who runs an organization as well as anybody, can run any organization, Iowa GOP Chair, Jeff Kaufmann. Jeff, great job Jeff. What a job. You got a record crowd tonight, Jeff. And you�re the one that started this whole thing, I will tell you. �Sir, do you mind coming out to Iowa?� �Sure Jeff, anytime.� I didn�t know it would be such a big deal with the Iowa football game, but that was pretty big. That was pretty big. Donald Trump: (01:15:23) And also, former Acting Attorney General, a friend of mine, a great, great guy. And there�s somebody up in heaven looking down on you right now because he loves his pop, Matt Whitaker. Matt, he loves his pop. Do you understand that? We love Matt. He was a football player. He was a football player, look at the size of that guy, huh? He was a great football player. Donald Trump: (01:15:52) Under our administration, we accomplished more in four years than almost any President ever dreamt of accomplishing. What we did with the military. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts in the history of our country. We stood up to China, never has anybody done this to China. We took in billions and billions of dollars when nobody else was able to take in 25 cents. Nobody took in money from China. And when China economically attacked our great farmers, we remember that Kim very well, don�t we? I went back and I started doing tariffs on China, and I took out $28 billion over a two year period. I gave it to our great farmers all over the country, including Iowa. Donald Trump: (01:16:43) And Chuck Grassley wanted me to do it, and Kim wanted me to do it. We gave $16 billion and $12 billion. They made so much money. Those farmers are so rich. You remember what I said? I said to the farmers, I said, �You�re going to suffer for a little while because we negotiated an incredible trade deal with China.� I don�t know if they�re going to honor the deal under Biden, but they sure as hell honored it under me, and the farmers made a lot of money. Donald Trump: (01:17:11) But do you remember what I said? �Go out and buy yourself more land and bigger tractors.� Do you remember? It turned out to be true. They�ve never been so successful as they are now because of what we did. Don�t give credit to the guy that�s sitting there right now. He doesn�t like farmers. I then signed a trade deal with China that made so much sense because they were taking such advantage of our country, but the farmers were the biggest beneficiary, and manufacturers too. Donald Trump: (01:17:41) I kept my promises. I kept my promises to Iowa. I kept my promises to everybody, and I kept my promises to protect Iowa ethanol, and that turned out to be a very important promise. Thank you, Kim, for getting us so involved in that. I approved E15 for use all year round, and I allowed higher� Donald Trump: (01:18:03) � E15 for use all year round, and I allowed higher ethanol gasoline to be distributed from existing pumps. Remember they wanted it brand new, brand new. I said, �What�s the difference?� No difference. You just have to spend a fortune in doing it. So I used existing pumps. And with the help of Iowa farmers, we became energy independent for the first time ever, ever. They say, �75 years.� Ever. And America was respected again and respected like we have never been respected before. Donald Trump: (01:18:34) Under Joe Biden, America�s no longer respected. And the world watched the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal, and they took � You just see what they look. Every night, they were watching. Every day, they were watching. Our borders were exploding and the fake news refused to report it, but everybody saw it. And they see it now. And by the way, it�s worse now than it was last month and worse now than it was two months and three months and four months ago. It�s at a level that is unsustainable by any country. Donald Trump: (01:19:07) And again, they�re emptying their prisons, and people are coming into our country. We should never allow this to happen. They�re destroying the United States of America, and our credibility has been literally thrown the window. And now the Democrats want to send $10 billion to Afghanistan. Despite the fact that when Biden, hopelessly surrendered to them just a month ago and moved our military out first, we left them with the $85 billion of the finest military equipment in the world. And now he wants to give them $10 billion of your taxpayer money on top of everything else. And we shouldn�t do that, unless � here�s an idea. We have breaking news, unless they�re willing to give back 100% of the military equipment that our television generals left behind. Isn�t that a good idea? Donald Trump: (01:20:11) I mean, you hate to give them 10, but it�s � I wouldn�t give many money unless they gave us back the equipment. I wouldn�t do anything. And remember this, we also have American hostages over there. They haven�t played that game yet. They will. That�s why they�re doing � They�re paying the 10 billion, because we have so many people over there. And I guarantee the Taliban, very tough, very smart. Afghans, great negotiators. And they say, �What are you going to do, if we give back the people that automatically would�ve just walked out with us very easily?� And they weren�t doing anything. We could have taken six months, a year, two years, five years, or we could have taken two months, could have done it as fast as we want. They were leaving us alone. They didn�t like jets over their heads, with machine guns and bombs. They didn�t like it, as tough as they may be. But you know what�s happened? They look at us now, like we�re stupid people. Donald Trump: (01:21:06) So we shouldn�t be giving them $10 billion. And if we do give them 10 billion, we demand every ounce of equipment back. And we want our hostages back immediately. And if we don�t get our hostages back � And you know the amazing thing about politicians? I�ve never heard that idea. That idea�s never been thrown around. They don�t even think of these things. But think, how much sense � Donald Trump: (01:21:29) I don�t want to give them 10 billion, but if we�re going to give them � Let Russia give them money, by the way, let Iran give them money. That�s their territory. And they�re right there. We�re doing their work for them. And then we�re supposed to keep them going. Biden�s giving them $10 billion so that he doesn�t look bad. Because they�re tough, and they�ll do numbers on us. Donald Trump: (01:21:47) Now, we want our hostages back immediately and we want our equipment back immediately. And then we can start talking about doing what we could do. I wouldn�t mind doing it under those � We want our hostages back. We want our equipment back, and then we can start talking about that. Audience: (01:22:19) [crosstalk 01:22:19]- Donald Trump: (01:22:21) So leaving Afghanistan was a good thing. I was going to leave. We should have left however, under the symbols of strength and dignity, not weakness and surrender. We could have left under strength and dignity in the same period of time. It didn�t have to take long. We could have been respected right now. I don�t know that we�ll ever recover from this, from allies to everything else. And you know what? Every ally�s take an advantage of us. So I�m less concerned about. They all take advantage. Or NATO, they take advantage, Germany, France, all of them. We�re like the stupid people. We�re like a country run by stupid people. Every single nation and every deal that I�ve looked at, and I looked at countries that many people have never even heard of, we made bad deals. Every single country. It�s almost, you wonder, how do you sustain? How does it keep going? Donald Trump: (01:23:17) Our soldiers are heartbroken at what happened in Afghanistan. They wanted to win. They wanted to be respected. They wanted to show strength, and our television generals wouldn�t allow them to do that. Just imagine how hard China is laughing, when they see our woke politicians and woke generals, injecting poisonous ideologies into our schools and into our military. You�ve seen the military of China. You�ve seen what they have, a million soldiers standing out on the square. You think they�re told about the things that we are telling our soldiers and our school children? They laugh in our face. They think we�re a failing nation. And I ended all of that. But one of the first things they did when Mitch McConnell said, �We have to get back to business.� Mitch McConnell should have challenged that election, because even back then we had of material to challenge that election. He should have challenged the election. Schumer would�ve challenged the election, but Mitch McConnell didn�t have the courage to challenge the election. He�s only a leader because he raises a lot of money, and he gives it to senators. That�s the only thing he�s got. That�s his only form of leadership. He should have challenged the election. He said, �Now we have to get back to work. We have to get back.� And the first thing that happened is Biden signed 17 executive orders that were devastating to our country. And now the Democrats want $6 billion in new federal funding to teach critical race theory, which I ended in our schools at the same time that Biden is unleashing the FBI on parents who stand up and object at school board meetings. The parents are the enemy. Biden is using federal law enforcement to threaten and silence citizen who oppose radical left indoctrination. To Joe Biden, the hated Taliban, our enemy for many years, killed many soldiers, we killed many of them, is an enforced upon us partner because of their weakness and their stupidity while patriotic American moms and dads are the enemy. Donald Trump: (01:25:43) That�s what�s happened to our country. Along with the constant use of city, state, and federal prosecutors, this chilling left-wing tyranny is the kind of thing you see in Russia and China and Third World dictatorships. It�s un-American. It�s got to stop. We�re not going to have a country left. We�re not going to have a country left. The only thing the radical Democrats are good at is hoaxes, witch hunts and abuses of power. You saw where the Russia, Russia, Russia was a totally made up and paid for by the Democrats and crooked Hillary scheme. Donald Trump: (01:26:23) For five straight years, it has been a con job, one after another. One con job after another, a nonstop parade of fake whistle-blowers, phony investigations, twisted conspiracy theories, and very, very perverted lies. First, it was Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, �I don�t know anything about Russia.� People would come up to be, �Sir, do you know anything about Russia?� People that worked for me early on. I said, �No, I don�t. Didn�t even think about it.� Month later, somebody comes up, �Sir, so great to meet you. Sir, do you know anything about Russia?� �No, I don�t. I don�t.� I wonder why he asks. Another one would come couple of months later, �Sir, do you know anything about Russia?� Now, I�m starting to say, �What the hell�s going on with Russia?� And then it started. Donald Trump: (01:27:21) And they said they were going to impeach me before I even got sworn in. They said, �We�re going to impeach Trump.� It was in The Washington Post. Three days before I got sworn in, they said, �We�re going to impeach Trump.� And I mean it, I had to run a country .and I had to survive. Those were my two jobs and the surviving was tougher than running the country, but then it was Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. Donald Trump: (01:27:46) Remember that? A phone call, perfect phone call. In fact, some of the senators said, �I never knew he could be so nice.� The call was so good, and I got impeached. But we had impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, the witch hunt against Justice Kavanaugh, Supreme Court Justice. It was a witch hunt. And then it became, and that�s what we�re doing now, every story you see, they�ll quote all these numbers and all this stuff. And there�s many more. This was just a small sampling of the things that they found. And every story, these fake people, crooked people write, they say, �There is no evidence of election fraud.� You ever see that? You read the papers. You�re reading about this. Then they say, �While there�s an election, there is no election fraud.� While these claims are totally unsubstantiated, they are. There�s massive evidence, or it�s a big lie. Donald Trump: (01:28:43) Remember that? The big lie. That�s what they � While it�s a big lie. And on MSDNC, which is also dying in the ratings, but between the two of them � That�s why I really thought that MSDNC and CNN would sometime prior to the election endorse me. We want Donald Trump, because their ratings have gone down the tubes. But they called it the big lie. But the big lie turned out to be the corrupt election itself. But you ever notice where you always read in there, �While there is no evidence to prove this,� there�s so much evidence, it�s pouring out of our ears. We�ve never had so much evidence. Donald Trump: (01:29:25) And let them look at it, let them go over it, or let them prove it�s wrong. But the people of this country, whether it�s Arizona or Georgia, or Wisconsin or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and if you look at all of Michigan and others, the people get it more so than the politicians. With that being said, we have some great, great Republican politicians. And they proved that on Thursday, when they totally decimated the people that were making the Arizona presentation in Congress. Andy Biggs, Jim Jordan, Congressman Clyde. They totally devastated. It�s funny. They were going point after point. All bullshit. These other people, all giving all bullshit.. And within about 10 minutes, it was proven that the whole thing was a fraud, but the press didn�t want to report it. Donald Trump: (01:30:21) The left�s new obsession is the un-select committee. They have an un-select committee. I call it the [inaudible 01:30:27]. It�s called a select committee. For those of you that aren�t that aware. We have appointed a select committee. You know who�s on the committee? Swalwell, who likes the Chinese spy. Why aren�t they investigating Swalwell? What a sleazebag. Why aren�t they investigating him for being with � I say, �being with.� What is being with? I�ll give you a definition afterwards. For being with a Chinese spy. Why does he have to be with a Chinese spy? And he�s on the big committees. But we have all these people. Donald Trump: (01:31:03) And then of course we have the warmonger-er Liz Cheney. She�s a real beauty. She�s going to lose big in Wyoming. Think she�s down to 9% approval. Terrible. But as I�ve said before, the truth is a force of nature. It�s going to come out. It�s all coming out. Hang in there. Everything the extreme left touches throughout history, it leads to misery and destruction and failure. But with all of you in Iowa and conservative patriots all across the country, we will end their reign of radicalism, and we will take back America. We�re going to take back America. Audience: (01:31:47) [crosstalk 01:31:47]. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA- Donald Trump: (01:32:12) Such a great country, such a loving country. With the Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for American families, fair trade for American workers and more American factories. Remember for two years, I�ve been coming up, talking about factories. And five years ago, when I started in Iowa, I talked about your farms, and I talked about factories all over the country. And the job we did was incredible, but it�s being wiped out by people that have no clue as to what � Or they may have a clue. And that�s even more dangerous. They may. But American factories forging more product, stamped with that beautiful phrase, �Made in the USA.� Made in the USA. We will shut down Joe Biden�s border disaster, and we got to do it quickly. We can�t let this go on. This is poisoning our country. People say, �Three years.� They say, �Two years. Sir, you�ll win in three years.� We�re not going to have a country left in three years. Donald Trump: (01:33:22) We�ll again, end catch-and-release. We will stand strong and demanding that we start up, remain in Mexico. They couldn�t come into our country until we had them fully checked out. Most didn�t make it. And most didn�t come up, because they knew they weren�t going to make it. So we didn�t have a problem, where millions of people are pouring up through South America. We will quickly complete the border wall, and we will end illegal immigration once and for all. We will have to start it all over again. Would�ve been so much better if we had an honest election, but we�ll be able to do it again. We will hold China accountable for unleashing the virus and charge them trillions of dollars for the unbelievable suffering they have caused to our country and all around the world. Donald Trump: (01:34:17) We will reign in the big tech monopolies, crooked as can be. We will reject left-wing cancel culture, and we will restore the right to free speech in America, which we don�t have anymore. We don�t have it anymore. There is no free speech. We don�t have free speech anymore. It used to be automatic, free speech. We don�t have free speech. We have the opposite of free speech. And this is the beginning of communism, when you hear that. This is the beginning of communism. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our Constitution. We will defend the Second Amendment, and we will proudly uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation�s founding. Donald Trump: (01:35:11) We will care for our great veterans. I love our veterans. I love our veterans. We had the highest approval rating of any president for taking care of our veterans. 92%, 92%. We will continue to strengthen our military and give our police officers, border patrol, ICE and law enforcement our 100% support. We love you. You know we love you. The whole country loves you. Donald Trump: (01:35:47) We will ban critical race theory in our classrooms. We will ban that horrible, crazy, critical race theory in our military. We will ban it from our workplaces. We will ban it from our federal state and local governments. It will be banned, permanently banned, and will never be allowed to come back again. We will restore patriotic education to our schools, and we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history and to always respect our great American flag. Donald Trump: (01:36:38) Our movement is the greatest and most powerful in the history of our country. And it�s based on one thought, make America great again. Yet we are up against some of the most sinister forces and entrenched interests that anyone has ever seen in our country. We�ve never encountered anything like this. But no matter how big or powerful they may appear, you must never forget that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you, belongs to you. Donald Trump: (01:37:22) This is your home. This is your heritage and our magnificent American liberty is your God-given right. And just in closing, I just want to say the United States of America will not tell you how to live, how to think, what to do. You will not be bossed by incompetent, dishonest, disgusting politicians, by big tech tyrants, by left-wing bullies or anybody else, because we are a great, proud and sovereign people. We know what to do. We are a great, proud and sovereign nation. We are born free. We will live free, and we will win again like we�ve never and ever won before. Donald Trump: (01:38:21) The great state of Iowa, and it is indeed a great state, was founded by strong and righteous frontiersmen and magnificent pioneer women who defied the dangers in order to carve out a life and a home for their families. They tamed the wilderness. They braved the elements. They tilled the soil, they worked the fields. And they poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest nation and the history of the world. And we will never let anyone take that away from us. Never. Our ancestors summoned the courage to fight and win our independence and wars against the most powerful nations on earth. We won the First World War. We won the Second World War. Afghanistan, we couldn�t even take our troops out properly. Think of it. They stormed the beaches to crush fascism. They found the strength to topple communism. And that�s what�s happening with our country today. Communism. Donald Trump: (01:39:34) Communism is happening with our country today. We�re not going to let it happen. We will not be afraid of woke agitators who despise our country, hate our people and ultimately want us to lose. They want us to lose. There is no mountain we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. There is no challenge we cannot meet. There is no victory we cannot have, as long as we remember that we are proud and mighty Americans. We have great people. Donald Trump: (01:40:12) We have great people. And JJ and Janet, thank you, JJ and Janet, friends of mine are here today. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never ever back down, and we will never, ever surrender. We will never surrender, like they just did in Afghanistan. Donald Trump: (01:40:39) My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. And remember this. Look at the crowd tonight. In theory, there�s not even an election and yet you broke records. We have bigger crowds now, everywhere. Not just in Iowa, everywhere. We have bigger crowds everywhere. There�s more spirit now than there was before the election. Nobody ever thought a thing like that could happen. Donald Trump: (01:41:09) Thank you. Audience: (01:41:09) We love you. Donald Trump: (01:41:09) Thank you very much. Audience: (01:41:11) We love you, we love you. Donald Trump: (01:41:20) Greatest movement in the history of our country. And it�s never even challenged when I say that. The fake news never says, �Well, it�s not really true there was a movement.� There�s nothing they can say. There�s never been a movement like this. I remember one politician many years ago, came in second in a certain state. And he became famous for many, many years because he came in second. We won 34 states. We did a job that nobody�s ever done. There�s never been anything like it. You are the people that built this country. We�re not going to take that away. You are the people that built this country. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. God bless you. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you very much. I�ll see you soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow, this is a big crowd. I�ll tell you. This goes all the way back. I wish they�d show it because they just don�t do that. They don�t like� This goes all the way back. I just looked at it on television, but it�s our television. We show it, but they don�t show it. You know why? Because they�re fake news. Right? They�re fake news. Hello, Alabama. And I�m thrilled to be back in your incredible, wonderful state that we won by a record number. We won this state. We also won a lot of other states by numbers that they don�t tell you about. We did have a rigged election. Didn�t we. It was terrible, terrible. And you look at what�s going on now. You look at what�s going on now and the border, but take a look at Afghanistan, what�s happening. Donald Trump: (09:47) But I�m with thousands of proud, hardworking, incredible American patriots. With your help, we�re going to elect our friend, Mo Brooks, to the U.S. Senate. We�re going to fire Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, and the radical left. And we�re going to make America great again. We have been making it so great. Now they�re biting into that, but we�re not going to let that happen. We can never let that happen. That�s why I had the idea� All my ideas� Someday, they�re going to tell me how to do things. But I liked the George Patton piece. Did you like that, General Patton? I thought so. Because we�re getting a little tired of the woke generals that we have. Right? Where they move our military out before they move our civilians. And before they move $83 billion worth of equipment. Let�s move them out. And the Taliban looks and they say, �I can�t believe it. This could only happen to us. I can�t believe it. The military left.� They go in. We have 45,000 people there, Americans, anywhere from, I guess, 15. They have no idea how many. That�s even worse. They say, �It could be 10. Oh, it could also be 45,000.� But it�s a lot of people and equipment like nobody has anywhere in the world 83 billion dollars. Donald Trump: (11:12) One year ago this month, in my nomination acceptance speech, which you remember. A lot of you were there. I see a lot of you that were there. I warned the entire country of the disastrous consequences of a Biden presidency. I understood it. A lot of you understood it too. I said that Joe Biden would eliminate America�s borders in the middle of a pandemic. He did. I predicted that he would unleash a wave of violent crime that would turn our cities into a nightmare of killing and bloodshed. You look at these Democrat run cities, Chicago, L.A., big cities, small cities, everyone run by a Democrat, New York. They don�t prosecute people in New York, only Republicans they prosecute. They don�t prosecute murderers and killers. They prosecute Republicans. It�s misconduct. It�s called prosecutorial misconduct. But I told you this was going to be happening. We stated it loud and clear. Donald Trump: (12:14) We said he would impose crippling shutdowns and restrictions on in-person schooling and that these painful policies would nonetheless fail to stop the virus. He didn�t stop the virus. They say, �Oh, he gets wonderful marks.� He doesn�t get good marks. He�s done a terrible job, including on vaccinations, including on everything else. And now the virus is back. The virus is back. I�m shaking hands with everybody backstage. I say, �Well, I don�t know. Is this a good thing or bad?� You�ll read about it in three or four days maybe, hopefully not. Donald Trump: (12:51) But I said that Biden would embolden America�s enemies. And that�s what he�s done. And that the radical Democrat socialist agenda would set our nation on the road to economic ruin. You look at what�s going on with inflation. Has anyone noticed that your gasoline is now at levels that you never thought you�d see again, six months ago? So we had $1.87 a gallon and we had a thriving industry, energy independent. Nobody thought we�d ever be energy independent. We didn�t need the Middle East. We didn�t need them. And now you have over five dollars in many cases and it�s going, even here, it�s going to be over five very soon. Donald Trump: (13:39) And I saw the other day before this whole thing with Afghanistan started� Because right now nobody�s talking even about energy, even about the horrible border condition that they�re allowing millions of people to come into our country. People that we have no idea, but people aren�t talking about that. They�re talking about the disaster of Afghanistan. Donald Trump: (13:59) Not only have my predictions come 100% true, but it�s even worse than any of us could have imagined in our worst nightmare. Nobody thought this kind of thing could happen. Biden has obliterated our border, given up our energy independence, caused soaring inflation. He failed totally on economic and policies. I mean, you look at what�s going on. It�s crazy. And the senators that voted for this 1.2 trillion dollar bill of which they call it infrastructure, but only 11% is infrastructure. Where the hell are these people coming from? It�s the roadmap. They call it the glide path. Donald Trump: (14:43) It�s the roadmap to the Green New Deal, conceived and dedicated by A.O.C., a real beauty. She�s a real beauty. She knows more about the environment. I don�t think she ever even took� Did she ever take a course? She wasn�t a good student. Did she ever take a course on the environment? Remember, remember when at first she said you have 12 years to live. She said that two years ago. It means you have, right now you�re about nine and a half years. Somehow, you�re not worried about that, but you are worried about China and Russia and other places. Okay. Donald Trump: (15:19) We rebuilt our military stronger, bigger, better than ever before. And now I see it being dissipated and being given� Our military is being given to the enemy. Donald Trump: (15:35) Biden failed totally on the pandemic. And he�s now overseeing the greatest foreign policy humiliation in the history of the United States of America. This is the greatest humiliation I�ve ever seen. Biden�s botched exit in Afghanistan is the most astonishing display of gross incompetence by a nation�s leader, perhaps at any time that anybody�s ever seen. Name another situation like this. Vietnam looks like a master class in strategy compared to Joe Biden�s catastrophe. Donald Trump: (16:11) And it didn�t have to happen. All he had to do is leave the soldiers there until everything�s out our citizens, our weapons, then you bomb the hell out of the bases. We have five bases. And you say, �Bye, bye.� You say, �Bye, bye.� The scene of those big giant planes, taking off with people hanging on the sides and falling off, there�ll never be anything like that. That�s worse than the helicopters. You remember the helicopters taking off the roofs. This blows it away. Not even a contest. This will go down as one of the great military defeats of all time. And it did not have to happen that way. This is not a withdrawal. This was a total surrender. It was a surrender for no reason. They weren�t asking. We had them. I dealt with Abdul. He was the leader. I said, �Abdul, anything happens, we are going to reign terror upon you. It will be a terrible thing. Don�t touch our American citizens. Don�t ever come to our country. Don�t ever come to our country. And you�re going to continue fighting your civil war.� I can�t do that. They�ve been fighting it for hundreds of years. That�s what they do is they fight and they�re good fighters. But I had a good relationship other than that one statement. After I said that, I said, �Now let�s get down to business.� And we had a conditions-based agreement. And they didn�t meet the first two conditions and we hit them hard. And then they met them. And then they had a couple of other conditions that they were ready to meet. And then we had a rigged election and we had a new President. And the new President came into office, and he dropped to his knees and he said, �Come on in and take everything that we have.� This is a disgraceful thing. The most embarrassing thing that we�ve ever seen in this country. There�s never been an embarrassment. And the nations of the world, both friend and foe are looking at us and saying, �What the hell happened so quickly to the United States of America? They can�t believe it. Donald Trump: (18:28) The equipment that they�ve got is the most sophisticated military equipment in the world. He surrendered our air base. He surrendered our weapons. He surrendered our embassy. They spent a billion dollars building this ridiculous embassy. And he abandoned our great American citizens. They�re over right now. They have no idea. Remember this, the Taliban�s tough and they don�t respect our country and they don�t respect our President. It�s not good. They�re over there now. And they don�t know what�s going to happen, our citizens. Joe Biden was going on vacation as Afghanistan was going to hell. Donald Trump: (19:12) And this is what you get when you have weakness in the White House. You can�t have weakness in the White House. They have to respect your President. When I was President, we only had strength. Remember the 59 shots we took at Syria? 59 missiles, every single one of them hit their target from 700 miles away. And I was sitting with President Xi of China, you remember? Having chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. It was wonderful cake. And when I said to him, what we had just done, the missiles were launched, he looked at me and he goes, �Repeat.� I didn�t know. He spoke English actually. He said, �Repeat.� I said, �What did you just say, repeat?� So he spoke a little more English than I thought, because he never said hello. But he said, �Repeat.� Donald Trump: (20:04) And I said, �We just shot 59 missiles in from ships very far away. Every one of them hit their target. It was an incredible display of talent and weapons.� And the reason we did that is because we had to. Because President Obama and Biden drew the red line in the sand and said, �Don�t cross it.� And they crossed it. And nothing happened. That�s when Russia got involved. Russia went in. They said, �Oh, nothing�s going to happen.� So Russia got involved. Other countries got involved. That red line in the sand from President Obama, that was just absolutely, it just didn�t matter. It was just words. That�s the problem with a lot of politicians actually, but not Mo. But it just doesn�t matter. When he said, �Red line don�t ever cross it,� and they crossed it and nothing happened. Donald Trump: (20:58) But the 59 missiles were an incredible display under my administration. Everyone in the world knew not to mess around with America. They knew that. They understood our power and that I would not hesitate to use it in defense of our citizens. And the Taliban understood that maybe as well as anybody. This would never have happened if I was President. Our country was so respected. Everybody respected our country. China respected our country. We took in billions and billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. They never gave us 25 cents. But then of course the China virus came and it was a lot different. My attitude toward China changed. As I personally told the Taliban leader, if anyone ever double crossed the United States of America, it would be the last thing they ever did. We said it loud and clear. And you knew it better than anybody in Alabama knew it. Because one thing, we won Alabama by a record. We won South Carolina by a record. And then they said we lost Georgia. How the hell did that happen? That doesn�t happen. No, we know how that happened. We know how it happened. Donald Trump: (22:29) But under our leadership, America was respected again. Our people did a great job. I�ve been watching Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State. He did a great job and he�s going around spreading the word. And General Kellogg and others have been great. But they understood this would never, could never happen. It could never happen. You never move the military first. You move the military last. We had total control militarily. They would have never come in. We could have kept them there for a long time, but 21 years, we want to bring them home. But we want to bring them home with dignity. Very soon we�re going to have September 11th and you�re going to have, because of Biden, the Taliban flag flying over our embassy, flying over our facilities. So that was not even a possibility that a thing like that could happen. Donald Trump: (23:25) We decimated ISIS. You remember that. ISIS, we had a great, great success. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And in a short period of time, we killed its leader and founder Al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the senior ranks of Al-Qaeda and we terminated the world�s top terrorist in Soleimani, who killed a lot of American soldiers and a lot of other people too. And they knew we weren�t playing games. They understood that right from the beginning. This proven record of America�s strength laid the groundwork to safely and responsibly bring our trips back home. Nobody was going to mess with us. And then this clown, they rigged the whole damn deal and he got in office. And now, now they�re taking advantage of us. And remember this, this isn�t stopping. This is going to go on for a long time. This is going to go on for a long time. This isn�t going away. This isn�t like a three-day hit. It�s going to go on for a long time. Donald Trump: (24:35) Taliban, great negotiators, tough fighters, great negotiators, they�ve got 45,000 people. You�ve got a lot of people also that deserve to be helped and they�re not going to let them be helped at all. This is going to go on for a long time. This is a great stain on the reputation of our country. Going into the Middle East was one of the most disastrous decisions that our country has ever been involved with. We�ve never had a decision. In my opinion, it was the� Donald Trump: (25:03) � been involved with. We�ve never had a decision, in my opinion, it was the worst decision that we�ve ever had. It was quicksand, quicksand. We should�ve gone in, knocked the hell out of it. I met a general, his name was general [inaudible 00:25:16]. I don�t even know, maybe he�s not even on my side, who the hell knows with these generals. When I get through with this guy Milley, I mean, how about Milley? Donald Trump: (25:24) Remember, remember? Remember, when I walked to the church, proudly walked to the church that the protesters, they tried to burn it down, but I walked to the church, protestors out there and Milley was walking with me. And the next day, the radical left media starts calling, �You shouldn�t have walked. You shouldn�t have walked.� Instead of saying, �I�m proud to walk with my President,� and not because it�s me because of the office. Instead of saying that, he wanted to apologize for walking with the President of the United States. Donald Trump: (25:58) And I said, � This guy doesn�t have what it takes.� And you�re seeing that now, because the worst decisions I�ve ever seen� That�s again, why I put the Patton, I just remembered it as I was coming over here. I said, �Get that clip quickly. The people of Alabama understand that clip.� Do you think that� Let me ask you, do you think that General Patton was woke? I don�t think so. What do you think Mike? Mike, was he woke? I don�t think so. Speaker 5: (26:33) We love you Trump. Donald Trump: (26:34) I don�t think he was too woke. He was the exact opposite. You know what woke means? It means you�re a loser. Everything woke, everything woke� It�s true. Everything woke turns to shit, okay. It�s true, it�s true. Look at what�s happening. Speaker 6: (27:04) USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. Donald Trump: (27:26) I got a little trouble. I said that our women�s soccer team was supposed to easily win, but they went woke except for a few of them. I love those women that stood up and they saluted our flag, there were some of them. But the one with the purple hair, she didn�t play too well. She went, well, you can have her. And they didn�t do too well, unfortunately. We want them to do well, but they didn�t. But it�s true about woke. You just take a look, everything goes bad. It�s really, it�s a shortcut to losing everything you have. They want to get rid of our great heroes and heroines. They want to get rid of our history, our culture. We�re not going to do it. Donald Trump: (28:12) We�re not going to do it. When they were starting to rip down our statues and it started with people, confederate people, generals, some respected, some not, but they�re taking down our culture and our heritage. And then it started with others. And then it went to Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee was part of our history and then it went to Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. Now, George Washington. In San Francisco they�re taken the name of George Washington off schools. Can you believe it? We�re not going to let this stuff go on. The hardest thing I had to do as president was signing letters to the families of soldiers who were killed in the Middle East. Often I called the parents, very often. Sometimes I went to Dover Air Force Base. That�s where the bodies of the soldiers would come in and I�d see them bringing a young man, young woman in a coffin. Donald Trump: (29:13) And I�d be with the parents. And I�ve told this story a couple of times. The parents would sometimes be unbelievable, you would almost not understand. It was like, �Sir, it�s so great to meet you.� And they�d always tell stories about their child. �So my son could throw a football so long. He was a quarterback in high school. He was a quarterback in college. Sir, I think he could have been in the NFL. He was really good. He was so great.� And we�re waiting for the plane to come in. And sometimes they�d be talking about their daughter. Lots of daughters were killed, coming out of the Middle East. �My daughter was so beautiful, Sir. She was so incredible. She was the greatest.� And I�d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover, the great people� We have great, by the way, we have great generals. We have great generals. The ones you see on television are not the ones that are great. Donald Trump: (30:07) We have great generals and we have great leaders and a great military that I rebuilt. I rebuilt it. It was exhausted. But I�d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover and they saw the bodies coming in many days of the week, I�d say, �General, it�s amazing. The parents seem so fine. They can handle it.� �No, they can�t, Sir.� I said, �No, I just spent a half an hour talking to them. They were okay. I mean, they understand what happened. They�re okay.� �No, they�re not, Sir. When that plane pulls up, Sir, that big unbelievable, powerful,� just like you saw three days ago with the bodies dropping off the sides. How desperate are people to leave when you�re hanging, clinging to a plane that goes up thousands of feet and you eventually have to let go, how desperate is that? Donald Trump: (31:06) How sad and how desperate. But when that cargo plane pulled up and that door opened, the general said, �Sir, when that door opens and you had the most beautiful young people carrying a coffin or a number of coffins off of the plane. Sir, when that happens, you�ll see, the parents are not okay.� So I was talking to people that seemed to be fine. I was amazed at their strength. And 10 minutes later, I watched that same mother and that same father screaming, screaming, running to the coffin, as it was being taken off, breaking security lines, you couldn�t stop them. I�ve never seen anything like it. And for what? And for what? And then you have a man who just retreats and gives up and it�s a disgrace. It�s a disgrace to our country. It�s a disgrace. It�s a disgrace to everybody. Donald Trump: (32:10) The most incredible people, but that was the saddest thing, seeing that Dover, you go to Dover. You go also to Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible doctors. I will tell you this, most incredible doctors. And you see the horrific injuries and you see the parents, the wife, the husband standing and looking over the body of somebody that was just absolutely shattered. In some cases, no legs. In one case, I�ll never forget, no legs, no arm. And then the other arm half and said to me, �Sir, I got lucky. I was able to save a half an arm.� And I�m looking and I�m saying, �We can never let this happen again. It was a terrible, terrible thing that happened. It was such a horrific mistake.� But these people represent our nation. They�re the greatest people our nation has ever had. Ever had. Donald Trump: (33:34) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So we had a deal where we were going to get out with great honor, and they weren�t going to play games. And we had them melded in with the government, but I�ve never been a big fan of Ghani. I always said he was a total crook. I�ve said it for years. It turned out he was a crook. He was a crook. And he left. He fled. He fled with a lot of cash. What we�ve done, how we got into that mess, it�s just amazing. But we could have gotten out with honor and we should have gotten out with honor. And instead we got out with the exact opposite of honor. Since my administration began negotiating a peace deal last year, somebody said, �Oh, he�s dealing with the Taliban.� Who the hell else am I supposed to deal with? Donald Trump: (34:24) Deal with the people that ran or the people that were highly paid, we paid the soldiers. They were among the highest paid soldiers of the world. I remember a certain, highly overrated general came to my office, �Sir, they�re fighting for their lives. They�re fighting For their country.� I said, �No, general, they�re paid more than any soldier in the world. And when that payment stops, they�re gone.� And that�s exactly what happened. Exactly what happened. But since my administration began the negotiations on the peace deal last year, not a single American service member has been killed in combat in Afghanistan. It�s over 18 months now, 18 months. Donald Trump: (35:05) And you know why that is? Not because the Taliban aren�t great fighters because they are great fighters. All you have to do is ask Russia, which used to be called the Soviet Union. And because of Afghanistan, it�s now Russia, much smaller version of what it was because of Afghanistan. They went bust, spending so many years and so much money and not winning in Afghanistan, but all of that money they spent, all of the lives they lost, same thing. But all you have to do is ask Russia, �What do you think?� Now I hear they going back in, not so fast. Everybody that�s gone in, hasn�t been so good. And you know what, we have to go in and we should go in when it�s right. And we now may have to be forced to go in because this person that is running our country made a horrific decision of taking all of our powerful military out. Donald Trump: (36:07) We may be forced to go in. And we may not be forced, but we may be forced to go in. And if you�re not prepared to go in, you�re never going to see those 45,000 people again. That I can tell you. If they don�t think you�re prepared to go in, you�re never going to see again, whether it�s 10 or 45,000 people, you�ll never see them again. All Joe Biden had to do was follow our plan. It�s like the border, all he had to do is go to the beach. He didn�t have to do anything. We had the tightest, most secure border. We built almost 500 miles of wall. He could have finished it in one month. Instead, he�s paying billions of dollars not to finish it. And I would have had it much earlier, but I got sued by the Democrats and Congress so much, took two and a half years for me to win the lawsuits. After we won all the lawsuits, we built it at a rapid pace. It was just about finished, helped us great. We set records, records at the border. All he had to do was go to the beach. Same thing here. All he had to do is follow our plan. That was conditional, so if they don�t follow it, then we start blasting them again. They didn�t want to be blasted. They were tired of being blasted. They were tired. They�re tough. Everybody�s tough. But you know what? We�re tougher, he just said it. But nobody would know it. Nobody would know it. When you look at what�s happening, nobody would know it. But we�re tougher, I�d like to explain that to Abdul and to everybody else. Donald Trump: (37:37) We�re much tougher. Please remember that. It�s hard for them to understand that now after watching this. Think of that, the soldiers have left. I could just see this, the leadership of the Taliban standing there, somebody walking up, �Sir, the soldiers have left Afghanistan.� He goes, �What?� �The soldiers have left.� And they�ve left all of their citizens behind and they�ve left $83 billion worth of equipment behind, including brand new Apache helicopters, thousands of Humvee vehicles with armor guard, equipment that nobody has ever even seen before, it was so sophisticated and good. So can you imagine these guys Abdul and his friends sitting there, that the United States soldiers, our military, has left. Donald Trump: (38:33) They walked in, they walked in and they took everything. It�s crazy. It�s crazy. I�ve never seen anything so stupid in my life. Somebody said, �Don�t say it, Sir. It�s not good.� I asked yesterday, I was with a group of people and there was a five year old child. And I explained the situation to the five year old child. They said, � No, you shouldn�t do that, Sir, because the press won�t like it.� I said, �That�s okay. I don�t mind. The press doesn�t like anything I do.� They actually do like it, but they�ll never say it, okay. But I asked the child, �So what would you do,� after describing, �Would you leave the military until everything�s out, including the civilians and all of that incredible military equipment? Or would you have the military go out first?� Donald Trump: (39:31) �Sir, I�d leave the military in.� He was five. He said, �I�d leave the military in, get everything out first.� I said, �Thank you very much.� But they didn�t want me to tell that story. They thought it was not an appropriate story, but it�s true. This is a five year old kid, five or six year old kid. And this is what we�re stuck with. But when Biden took office, he foolishly tore up our really good plan. Again, not a plan, it�s conditions. We do this, we do this, we do this. If you don�t do these things, we�re not going to do it. And then we start dropping bombs all over the place and they say, �You know what? We�re going to do it. We�ve decided to do it.� No, we had a good understanding. Donald Trump: (40:19) They always hate it. Remember when I came in, Obama said, �The worst problem we have is North Korea, Kim Jong-un.� I said, �What�s the problem?� He said, �I think you�re going to go to war with North Korea.� I said, �Have you ever called him?� �No.� Actually, he called him 14 times and was not responded to, but he told me, �No,� but that wasn�t truthful. I said, �Would be good to talk to him, wouldn�t it, rather than nuclear war, wouldn�t it be nice?� Anyway, through a series of events, I did talk to him and it was nasty at the beginning, remember? He said, �We have a red button on my desk.� And I said, �I have a much bigger red button. And my red button works and yours doesn�t.� And anyway, it was very nasty. And then all of a sudden, it became a love fest. It became great, right? Donald Trump: (41:08) And I went to North Korea, went to South Korea, went across the line. We got along great. There was no nuclear catastrophe, but you got to be careful because he does not respect Joe Biden. And he does not respect any longer America. But I said, it�s good to speak to people. I stopped the pipeline in Russia. I stopped it. Nobody�s ever been tougher to Russia, but I got along great with President Putin. We had a great relationship. He said, �You�re killing me with this pipeline.� I said, �Look, not right, Germany shouldn�t have been doing that.� The European union takes tremendous advantage of us almost as bad economically as China. Donald Trump: (41:49) People say, �Oh, that�s a terrible thing to say.� I say, �Really, how many Chevrolets are in Beijing right now? Maybe none.� Okay. They won�t take our cars. They won�t take our farm products. They won�t take anything. And I was hitting them hard. And then the China virus came and it was a terrible period of time. But we did the greatest job. And because the base was so strong, what we did was so strong, our country is doing well. It�s going to be blown now with all the inflation and everything else that�s taking place. But we built such a strong foundation that our country is doing great. And other countries are doing horribly, horribly. Remember they used to use anything to hit us. When we got hit, I closed it to China, closed it to Europe, anything to hit us. But they�d say, �In South Korea, they�re doing so well.� South Korea is being decimated right now. �India is doing so well.� India is being decimated right now. We did a great job on that. The ventilators, the equipment that we got, the cupboards were all bare. Donald Trump: (42:50) Everything that we did, and then we developed a vaccine, three vaccines in three months, in nine months. And actually, I�ll tell you, it was three days less, three days less than nine months. And it�s great. And you know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. But you got to do what you have to do, but I recommend, take the vaccines. I did it. It�s good. Take the vaccines, but you got� No, that�s okay. That�s all right. You got your freedoms. But I happened to take the vaccine. If it doesn�t work, you�ll be the first to know, okay. I�ll call up Alabama and say, �Hey, you know what?� But it is working. But you do have your freedoms. You have to keep, you have to maintain that. You have to maintain that. And you got to get your kids back to school. And the mask issue is interesting because Fauci said, �Masks are bad,� and now he�s a radical masker. Donald Trump: (43:47) Now he wants you to wear 15 different masks at one time. I don�t know. He also told me he was a great athlete. Then I saw him throw out a pitch at the baseball game. �I used to be a great athlete, Sir.� �You did, really? Oh, that�s good.� Then I watch him on television. That�s not [inaudible 00:44:04]. The ball almost went to first base, didn�t it? The issue here is not about whether to leave Afghanistan. The issue is Joe Biden�s staggering incompetence and gross negligence. He doesn�t know where the hell he is. You think, he�s running the government? He�s not running the government. Creating the greatest strategic humiliation that we�ve ever seen as a country. And it was something that we should�ve stopped and the general should have done something. They should have done something. Donald Trump: (44:37) They should have talked to him and said, �Look, Commander in Chief,� but you just couldn�t have done that. If he had that evacuate� If he just moved the people out, he should have done it and he should have done it first. He had to have done it first. Sometimes in life decisions are made and when those decisions are made, if they�re bad decisions, you�ve got to get away from them and you�ve got to get away from them fast. And if you don�t get away from them, you�re not going to have a country anymore. I said about elections, if we don�t have great elections, if we don�t have borders, if we don�t have the things that are being taken away from us, we�re not going to have a country anymore. And certainly, we�re not going to have a respected country anymore. Donald Trump: (45:22) With me in office, the Taliban would not have ever dreamt of capturing our airfield or parading around with our American weapons. Did you see all those guns they have? Who recognized those guns, because they�re same guns you had. We made them. There would have been no emergency embassy evacuation and no taking down of our flag. They took down our flag. Because we would have established clear lines that the Taliban would have never dared to cross. The problem with Biden is that our enemies are not afraid of him. They don�t respect him, our adversaries and our allies no longer trust him. They can�t trust him any longer. Remember he went back and he went to Europe and they didn�t know what the hell was going on. And they said, �What the heck.� We�re back. In other words, we�re back. Now you can continue to take advantage of us because Europe took advantage of us with NATO like nobody ever. I got Europe to pay $430 billion toward NATO. They would have never paid. For 15, 18 years, it was like this, the payment. Donald Trump: (46:35) And we�re protecting them. And some of them were totally delinquent. They didn�t pay. And I said, �You got to pay.� They said, �Sir, what would happen if we didn�t pay? Would you protect us?� I said, �If you didn�t pay, I would not recommend protecting you.� And it was amazing how fast that money came in, right? That money came in fast, 430. Started off with 130 billion. Billion, not million, billion. And then 430 billion came in very quickly. �We did a lot of good things with South Korea.� I said, �We protect you for nothing. You�ve got to pay. You�re a rich country. You make the boats, you make all of our television sets, which you took from us. Thank you very much. You make so many cars for us. You got to pay.� And they agreed. And they paid billions of dollars at my request. It wasn�t that easy. It took a little while, about two days. They agreed to pay billions of dollars, billions of dollars. And then I said, �Look, next year, wait till after the election. But you�re going to have to pay at least $5 billion.� Donald Trump: (47:39) �No, no, no. We will not pay.� I said, �Yes, you will pay. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.� He said, �No, no, no. President Moon, nice man, good man.� But he said, �No,� which he should say. Why should he, when he was suckering us for so many years. So he said, �No, no.� I said, �You�re going to have to pay five billion.� But then the election result turned out different than what it should have, different from the real result. And I just heard, they made a deal with South Korea to pay a cost of living adjustment. You know what that is? Nothing. When the money I raised, it�s like nothing. And that�s, so they were, that was another country, I�m sure, that was extremely happy with the results. But I did a great job in protecting them. I think I�ve saved them from Kim Jong-un. So I don�t think they� I tell you what, a lot of people from South Korea come up to me and say, �Thank you very much, Sir.� I really, I think I saved them from Kim Jong-un because of the relationship I developed with Kim Jong-un. Donald Trump: (48:41) Biden is the most pathetic president. And look, he makes Jimmy Carter look great, right? Look at that man with that jacket. I love you, man. How many rallies have you come to? What number is this? Speaker 7: (48:55) 30. Donald Trump: (48:56) Much more than that. He�s all� Much more. We have some women. Are they here tonight? North Carolina. Where are they? Where are they? We have some women, they�ve been to 96. I didn�t even know we did 96. I said, �How many?� �Sir, we�re up to about 96. I said, �I didn�t know we did that many.� But, look, this is a very unpleasant subject, but still, is this the greatest place to be in the world? And it�s [inaudible 00:49:25], right? It�s unpleasant to talk about it, but sometimes you have to think and talk about unpleasant things, but not only is it Biden and the embarrassment to the United States abroad. His radicalism and extremism is currently destroying our nation right here at home. And nobody understands that better than Alabama, nobody. Remember when Biden used to go and say he�s an Iowa and he�d say, �It�s great to be an Idaho.� Sir, you�re in Iowa. Donald Trump: (50:03) And he�d say, �It�s great to be an Idaho.� �Sir, you�re in Iowa.� He would do this all the time. He was in New Hampshire, �It�s great to be in Maine today.� �Sir, you�re in New Hampshire.� The worst was when he was in New York and he said it�s great to be in Florida. There were no palm trees. �Great to be in Florida,� he�d do it all the time. I�ve never done it yet. I�ve never done it, with all of them speeches I�ve made. I was just saying, because I said Alabama. But I know exactly, I didn�t have to think about it. It�s called Alabama. I love Alabama. I�ve always loved Alabama. Donald Trump: (50:37) And I�ve always said if that ever happens, you can forget about the rest of the night because the speech is a total disaster. In other words, �It�s great to be in South Carolina with you people tonight,� I�d say, if that ever happened it�s a disaster. You might as well just walk off the stage. Because you could be Winston Churchill, great speaker� You could be Winston Churchill, the great Winston Churchill, make an increment rest of the speech and it�s a disaster. The only difference is, if you make a speech, if he does it, which he does all the time in different forms, the press doesn�t cover it. Donald Trump: (51:14) He�s the only guy that didn�t get covered falling, walking up the stairs. The press didn�t cover it other than a couple internet covered it, I guess. Right? Do you think they would have covered it if I fell on the Air Force One? He fell three times. � Down goes Frazier,� remember that? He kept going down and up, down and up. I said, �What the hell is going on here?� I was watching that. �Whats going on with our president?� And it wasn�t on one nightly news cast. I think I might�ve been on� I did the ramp, the long slippery ramp. I said, �General,� it was pouring out, pouring. I said, �General, this is a bad deal here. I got leather shoes on the bottom and I�m going to fall. I�m not going to let them�� So I walked down tiny little steps. Donald Trump: (52:05) �What�s wrong with the president?� The biggest story. I was so proud when I got down, I didn�t fall. I said, �General, I don�t want to grab you, but I may have to grab you.� Big, strong general, Commandant of West Point. You know I made my best speech at West Point that day. But then it was pouring, and when I went down the ramp and it was pure� Normally they have like some little grooves, nothing. It was like an ice skating rink. I think it was a trap. And I said, �General, this is not a good situation. That sucker looks slippery as hell. And I�m not going to allow them to tape me falling.� Remember Gerald Ford fell, that was not a good time. Some other bad things happened to presidents, not a good time. You can�t do that, you can�t let that happen. So what happened is they made that a big story. I was so proud of myself. I made my best speech and nobody talked about that speech. Someday, hopefully, they�ll go back and get the speech I made at the graduation of West Point two years ago. Donald Trump: (53:00) I�d love you to hear that speech. I called up the First Lady. I said, �First Lady, I just made a great speech.� She said, �You�re on television for the way you went down a ramp.� It�s all they talked about. But with him falling down the stairs, three times, he was down. No, he�s up! No he�s down again, Oh my God! No he�s up! He�s down again. He�s down for three times. You know, if that were a fight, they�d stop it. Right? If that were a fight.They would�ve stopped it, Mike. In a matter of mere months, Biden has thrown our southern border wide open. When I left office we handed the new administration the most secure border in US history and they turned it into the greatest border disaster in American history, probably anywhere in the world. You know, they�re emptying their prisons out into our country. Donald Trump: (53:49) And I�m not just talking about Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. I�m talking about Middle Eastern countries. Yemen, people are coming in from Yemen. Our country will really be in trouble. We�ll really be in trouble. Donald Trump: (54:06) Under my administration we ended the ridiculous catch and release. You catch somebody, you find out they�re a criminal and you release them immediately into our country. We ended asylum fraud. We deported record numbers of criminal aliens. We negotiated historic agreements with Mexico and Central America to stop illegal immigration. And we built all of that wall that I just talked about. Donald Trump: (54:32) But we had a Stay in Mexico policy. �You can�t come into our country, I�m sorry. Stay in Mexico.� Biden ended it. He ended it. But you know what happened? Yesterday we won in court and a very wise judge said we�re allowed to have Stay in Mexico. Thank you, judge. Thank you, judge. Thank you very much. They use to stay in the United States and then you�d never find them again. You�d stay, and some of these people are seriously tough criminals. Donald Trump: (55:05) I achieved a 90% reduction in illegal border crossings. Think of that 90%, it was going to go much higher. And brought illegal immigration to a virtual halt. It was the lowest levels ever recorded and you could come into our country, but you had to come in legally. Finally, we did it, but we had a win a lot of court cases. Many of those court cases started against us by Democrats in Congress. Donald Trump: (55:29) Under the Trump administration our message was clear, if you try to come here illegally you will be caught, you will be detained and you will be immediately sent back home where you belong. Donald Trump: (55:44) And when people heard that� And they hear it, they�re genius, it�s genius. When people heard that and then they saw the results, because there wasn�t games, it was happening. They never came. They stopped. Remembered at the beginning with the caravans, we ended the caravans. But now the caravans are back at a level that nobody�s ever seen. Bigger, stronger, more powerful. It�s a disgrace. Donald Trump: (56:08) Now the radical left Democrats have surrendered our sovereignty to the coyotes and drug cartels, child smugglers, human traffickers, and they usually traffic in women. Biden stopped wall construction, instituted nationwide catch and release, wanted it back, and invited the entire world to make a mad dash for the USA when he said, �Come. You�re welcome.� Donald Trump: (56:35) I don�t know if he knew? Do people think this is a good thing, what happened? They�re destroying our country. Last month alone, border patrol, who we love apprehended a mind boggling 210,000 illegal border crosses. You can multiply that times 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the people that come in without getting caught. They say, you can use numbers like that. Donald Trump: (57:03) Record numbers are getting away and historic numbers are coming from outside Mexico and Central America from every corner all over the world. A lot of them coming in from the Middle East. At this rate, millions of illegal aliens will cross our border just this year alone. Millions. Millions of people, many of these people are hardened criminals, murderers. Again, think of this. Just think of this statement� They are emptying their jails into the United States. Donald Trump: (57:36) Think of that. A lot of people don�t know what that means. They are the toughest, meanest jails. They�re emptying them into the United States. This massive overcrowding on our border is a super spreader disaster that will bring new variants into our nation. And honestly far worse than variants, far worse. Donald Trump: (57:58) MS-13 is being replenished to levels never seen before. I brought MS-13 through ICE and Border Patrol out, by the thousands. Thousands. We were going into towns in Long Island, and these were brave warriors like law enforcement is, we have so much respect. And they�d go right into what they call a �nest� of a lot of these gang members, and they�d start fighting. Donald Trump: (58:26) All these guys that I know, my friends in the first row, I know every one of them very well. Not one of them would do this job. And if they did, they�d be knocked out in about two seconds. They wouldn�t do it well. They wouldn�t want to do it. ICE is, these are brilliant, great, tough, strong, but more important than anything, patriotic people. Donald Trump: (58:47) They would go into these towns and they would get these hardened criminals that are loaded up with weapons and they would get them the hell out of our country. It�s amazing what they did for us. And now they�re being treated horribly by this administration. Joe Biden is functionally abandoned ICE, shut down interior enforcement and turned our nation into a giant sanctuary for dangerous criminals. Donald Trump: (59:10) We have criminals coming in this country, nobody knows how bad it�s going to be. Watch, that�s another Trump prediction. In the Republican Party we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Donald Trump: (59:28) Under my administration, we found the gang members, drug dealers, and various MS-13 killers and we kicked� I mean quickly, we knock them out so fast nobody could believe it. Thousands! Thousands a year. And we quickly deported them or we put them behind bars where they belong. Sometimes they were so evil, so vicious we didn�t want to take a chance on bringing them back to their countries. Donald Trump: (59:55) And their countries didn�t want them, you know. You know that story. I�ve told that story. When I came in, we�d catch these people in Border Patrol, ICE, I�d meet with the top people. They�re incredible people. They�d say, �Sir, they won�t take the people.� I said, �What do you mean they won�t take them?� �They don�t want them back. They don�t want the gang members back. They don�t want the killers back. They won�t take them back.� Donald Trump: (01:00:17) When we fly in with an airplane, they put planes on the runway so we can�t land, we have to come back. The buses, they stopped. �They won�t take them back, sir.� None of the three major countries that we�re talking about, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, �Whey won�t take them back, sir.� Donald Trump: (01:00:34) I say, �Really? Do we give them any money every year?� This is early on, so I learned exactly what it was, but early on. You know, hadn�t done it too long, right? �Do we give them any money?� �Yes, sir!� �How much?� About $500 million a year, that�s a lot of money, right? Donald Trump: (01:00:51) So I said, �Good. Stop payment immediately. No more money going to these countries. No more money going to these countries.� I immediately stopped all of this 500 million, little more than that, 500 million going to the three countries. And a day went by and I got a call from all three of the heads of those countries who I knew and know and respect. They�re smart. They�re very streetwise people. They�re very smart and very, very streetwise. Donald Trump: (01:01:20) �Mr. President, you stopped many millions of dollars from coming into Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. You stopped it from coming in, Mr. President, is there something we did wrong?� Donald Trump: (01:01:33) �Yes. You�re not taking back people that came into our country illegally. You will not take them back.� �Oh, there must be some understanding, sir. We would love to have them back.� I said, �Congratulations, we�ll be sending lots of planes your way.� And we did, we got them all back and we still didn�t make the payment. I delayed that sucker a long time. We still didn�t make the payment, we waited a long time, but they took them all back. Donald Trump: (01:02:02) And then the other day I heard that Biden wants to give those countries $4 billion because he thinks that they�re going to spend the money on economic development. No, it�s going to go economic development into their bank accounts in Switzerland, okay? That�s the economic development we�re talking about. Donald Trump: (01:02:26) They want to give them $4 billion. They�re working on the paperwork right now. The money is going to be stolen. It�s going to be given to the cartels. It�s going to be given to the traffickers. It�s going to be kept by politicians. See, we only have honest politicians in our country, right? Like Mo. That�s true. Donald Trump: (01:02:49) We understand. And we�ve understood very much in America First that immigration security is national security. And that�s why we instituted the travel ban. Remember the travel ban? I took such heat where I was able to get people that came into our country from very tough countries� Very, very tough countries. And I was able to stop them from coming to our country because we didn�t want to have our stores blown up. We didn�t want to have buildings set on fire and death and destruction. Donald Trump: (01:03:21) So, we lost it in the lower court. We lost it in the second court. And then we won at the United States Supreme Court. And to show you how dishonest the press is, recently they wrote about it. They said, �He lost in court!� And they were right, at the lower court, but then I lost again. But then I won. Donald Trump: (01:03:39) I said, �You didn�t say I won.� �Well, you did loose.� In other words, technically they�re right, I lost in court. But I won and we have a travel ban. And without that travel ban, you would have some really bad, bad people in here from places in the world that are evil. And it was a great thing. Donald Trump: (01:03:55) I took a lot of heat over that travel ban. People said, �That�s not nice.� They all like to call it a �Muslim ban.� It wasn�t a Muslim ban, it was a travel ban from a lot of different countries that are bad and they send bad people to us. And because of the travel ban, we didn�t have to accept that. So it was a great success, but they try and make it look like it wasn�t very nice. Donald Trump: (01:04:15) We dramatically reduced refugee admissions and kept radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Is that okay? I mean, is that okay? One of the first acts that Biden did after Mitch McConnell said, �We must get back to work. We have to get our country going. We have to approve him as the president.� Even though the evidence was staggering, you�ll see the evidence starting to come out. It�s already come out, far beyond what we need. By the way� Far, far, far beyond what we need. Donald Trump: (01:04:48) �We have to get back to our country and running our country,� Mitch McConnell. And the first thing that Biden did was sign 17 of the worst executive orders in the history of our country. And one of them Biden revoked that beautiful, wonderful travel ban and has surged refugee resettlement from the most dangerous countries in the world. The most dangerous terrorists in the world. They come into our country now with no problem, �Come on in. Love to have you.� Donald Trump: (01:05:28) This is a sick culture and our country is a disaster and it�s going to die before your very eyes if this craziness isn�t stopped in so many ways. Donald Trump: (01:05:41) The Afghanistan thing is so simple to understand because, when people watch that, people that weren�t even into watching political things on the news� But when people watch this, they understood it immediately about the military. Don�t take them out, leave it to last. Sort of like the captain of a ship. �Let�s jump off first before the passengers, I�m getting the hell out of here.� Right? That�s what it is. The captain is supposed to wait and watch and work. Donald Trump: (01:06:13) But we�re seeing what happens when you have dishonest and rigged elections. This is what happens. This is what you get. Our nation is being destroyed from within by people who have no right to destroy it. No right. They have no right to destroy it. Donald Trump: (01:06:28) As everyone here understands, the 2020 election, that presidential election which was such a great day. At 10:00 it was over. Pennsylvania, Trump is winning by a lot. Arizona, Trump is winning by a lot. We don�t even talk about Alabama, there was nothing they could do with this one. There was nothing. Donald Trump: (01:06:51) You�re going to see things happening, it�ll go down as the most corrupt election in American history. And almost probably in any history. The evidence of the fraud is monumental and more is coming out. Just recently, Wisconsin election officials admitted they removed more than 200,000 voters. Donald Trump: (01:07:20) By the way, that�s 10 times more than I need to win, 10 times more. 200,000 from the voter roles and they did it, unfortunately, why didn�t they move them before the election? They removed them after the election. Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate it. They removed these names after the election was over. Approximately 20 times more than we needed. Donald Trump: (01:07:50) Earlier this month, it was revealed that in Georgia ballots were rejected by machines and illegally altered by hand to remove marks for Trump and instead cast votes for Joe Biden. You�ll see that coming in. You�re going to see many of it. Donald Trump: (01:08:06) In some states, you had a little thing, a little problem, more votes than voters. A little problem. Take a look at Detroit. �Sir, they have many more votes than they have voters.� Oh, that doesn�t sound so good, does it? Huh? And they needed just a little bit, just a little bit. Didn�t need all, didn�t need much of it. Donald Trump: (01:08:26) For example, in Nevada it was recently discovered that 15 out of the state�s 17 counties had more votes than voters in 2020. Think of that, Nevada run by Democrats. Yeah, I wonder how that happened? Donald Trump: (01:08:41) In Arizona, 11,000 individuals are now listed as having voted who were not even on the roles the day after the election. They weren�t listed on the roles. None of the margins in the state, remember this, the margin was less than 11,000 substantially. So that was much more than we needed. That was just one of many categories. Donald Trump: (01:09:08) The Arizona auditors have also collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers abolished signature matching entirely. Okay, well that sounds reasonable. No signature. In other words, �Whose signature is it?� �We�re not allowed to match.� �Oh, that�s great.� Donald Trump: (01:09:26) Maricopa County has refused to comply with an official subpoena to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they indeed counted ballots with no signatures at all. Many of the ballots weren�t signed, they were just thrown in there. Donald Trump: (01:09:44) Finally, a recent trend analysis of all 50 states based on population growth, voter history and voter registration data by one of the most respected people in that industry. Somebody so respected, a military person, Captain Seth Keshel found over 8 million excess Biden votes. In other words, he had 8 million more votes that he�s supposed to have. Speaker 8: (01:10:13) Throw him in jail! Donald Trump: (01:10:14) And his estimate is conservative, he considered it very conservative. And I believe he said he didn�t even go to the machines. This is without even looking at the machines. Remember I�m not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I am the one trying to save American democracy. Donald Trump: (01:10:43) The numbers speak for themselves. We got 12 million more votes than in 2016. I was told by the best pollsters in the world� Real pollsters, not the phony pollsters that are used by certain of the fake news media� If I got 1 million more votes I couldn�t lose. I got 12 million more votes, and we lost. Donald Trump: (01:11:09) You know, Obama the second time got millions fewer votes than he did the first time. He won. But I was told by the most talented pollsters, and polling is talent. Polling works, but not when it�s fraudulent polling. �Get 1 million votes, sir, you cannot lose. It�ll be an easy early evening.� We got 12 million votes and they said we lost, but we didn�t. Donald Trump: (01:11:33) We won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, which is unprecedented. We flipped 15 House seats. Remember we were going to lose 25-35 House seats. Instead of losing 25 or 35, we won 15. It was a big evening. And you know why? Because, they came in on our coattails. That�s what happened. The Congressmen will tell you that. And women, they will tell you that. Donald Trump: (01:12:02) And did not lose a single Republican incumbent in Congress. Think of that. For the first time� Congressmen, we never think of that. This was in decades and decades, we didn�t lose one seat. You know why? I hate to say it, because of me. It�s because of me. Donald Trump: (01:12:24) Despite the pandemic, 56%, this was a record, of Americans� This is during the pandemic� believed that they were better off in 2020 than they were in 2016 when I assumed office. Think of that, 56% is a record. And we had a pandemic going. A majority of Americans, 55%, want audits of the votes. They want audits. And they want the forensic audits, they don�t want the bullshit audits. And 88% of the American citizens, of our citizens, of our great people are demanding voter ID. Donald Trump: (01:13:20) Thank you. Here tonight is someone who has fought harder than anyone else in Congress to expose the election fraud, he is really a fighter, and to defend the integrity of our elections. And I have to say it, I just can�t imagine him losing. He�s got courage. He�s an honest guy. He�s an honest guy. And that gives him the courage. Your next us Senator from Alabama, Mo Brooks. Thank you. Donald Trump: (01:13:54) I know Mo spoke, but come up and say just a quick word Mo. He�s doing very poorly in the polls, he�s only up at about 90%. Come on, Mo. Mo Brooks: (01:14:09) Thank you Mr. President, and future President of the United States of America. I�m pleased to announce the second coming of President Donald J. Trump. Donald Trump: (01:14:30) Go get them Mo. Thank you Mo. Mo is a fearless warrior for your sacred right to vote. And so many other things, he�s going to be an incredible Senator and we�re proud of him. And we�re proud of my cherish, your cherished, by my cherished Alabama. I feel like� I don�t know, The relationship. The relationship has been so strong. Right at the beginning, before I knew anything, I just knew we had a thing called common sense together. Thank you. Speaker 8: (01:15:02) We love you! We love you! Donald Trump: (01:15:02) Thank you. Donald Trump: (01:15:02) � thing called common sense together. Thank you. Audience: (01:15:17) We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Donald Trump: (01:15:17) � everybody. Thank you. I love you too, but it is true. Early on I said, �How are we doing in Alabama?� �Sir, you�re up about 45 points.� This was before I knew any, I didn�t know what the hell it even meant. �45 points. That sounds good.� We�re up at the numbers that nobody�s ever seen before. We�ve never gone down, now we�re up higher than we ever were. And you also have somebody that is unbelievable. Unbelievable. He happens to be now a Senator. He was an unbelievable football coach, Tommy Tuberville. Tommy, stand up, Tommy. Where is Tommy? Where�s Tom? I love Tommy. Where the hell is he? Where is he? He�s here? The hell of a crowd. I want to tell you, this crowd goes so far back. See the cameras. We shouldn�t give that to the media because all they do is they block the view and they don�t say the truth, anyway. Donald Trump: (01:16:17) This crowd, see what this is? Goes hundreds of yards behind those cameras. Look at that. Man. Tommy, I love to see Tommy. I love Tommy. He�s doing a great job. I said, �Tommy, you you�re running for Senate.� And he did a good job. He was a natural and he was a rah-rah coach, but he was a great coach. I asked Urban Myers, �How good a coach was Tommy Tuberville?� He said, �He beat me twice. He�s the only one that beat me twice.� But I said, �Tommy, you beat Alabama six times.� I said, �How can you possibly expect the people of Alabama to vote for you?� He said, �Sir, because I gave them a coach named Sabin. Because of me they have�� Donald Trump: (01:17:11) I said, �Tommy, that�s the coolest answer I�ve ever heard.� And you voted him in and he�s been a great Senator. He�s been phenomenal. Thank you very much. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you very much. Credible guy, credible guy. And he�s got that look of a Senator. Doesn�t he? Not that looks matter. I always say looks don�t matter. You know, nowadays looks don�t matter, but he still got the look of a Senator. He�s doing a great job. Lieutenant governor, Will Ainsworth. Will, thank you, Will, great job. Nice meeting you backstage. Donald Trump: (01:17:48) Alabama Attorney General, Steve Marshall. Steve? Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Thank you very much. Representatives Jerry Carl, Barrymore, Gary Palmer. Robert, where�s Robert? Robert Aderholt. He�s been another one. Oh, and one of my favorite people. She�s so smart. I hope she�s around. I hope she�s around. She is an incredible woman. She�s a brilliant woman. Doesn�t get credit for it, but we all know about that stuff. Marjorie Taylor Green, Marjorie. Where is she? She�s great. She is great. She�s a warrior. Donald Trump: (01:18:51) A great gentlemen, Chief Justice of Alabama Supreme Court, Tom Parker. Tom, thank you very much. Thank you, Tom. A lot of power. State Senate president pro tem, Greg Reed. Greg, thank you very much. Thank you. State Senator Garland [inaudible 01:19:11]. Garland, thank you. State Representative Andrew Sirall. A man who�s done a fantastic job, Sheriff Matt Gentry. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. National committee man, Paul Reynolds. Thank you. Thank you very much. Donald Trump: (01:19:35) Alabama GOP chair, this guy is amazing. You know what you raised tonight? A record in the history of the Republican party. And I think also in the history of the Democrat party, if we can say that. You raised $1.2 million. And I didn�t ask for anything, I should have. I made a mistake. Marjorie, I made a mistake. You know, normally I�ll say, all right, we�ll raise money, but you take half. We take half. We put it into my campaign. We put it� I just said the hell with it. Alabama is so good. Keep the whole damn thing. He raised $1.2 million. John Wall, John? Great job, great job, John. Donald Trump: (01:20:20) It�s a record. A patriot, a wonderful man, a man who puts his guts into everything. A man that they don�t treat properly. He�s smart. He loves this country so much. He�s willing to die for this country. I watched him over the last week at his symposium, which was really amazing. Some of the people he had were incredible, incredible people. Mike Lindell. Mike? Donald Trump: (01:20:48) It�s true. I�ll tell you true. It�s true He had some people up there really� I mean, there was scientists, they were political scientists and beyond, and they were incredible. What they said and what they understand. Also, want to thank for covering us. So incredibly well, two wonderful young people with unbelievable futures, Natalie Harp and Christina Bob. Did you ever hear them? They are unbelievable. Natalie Harp and Christina Bob, two incredible people. Thank you. Thank you very much for the job you do. Both of you. Unbelievable, an unbelievable job. What a good future you have. Donald Trump: (01:21:45) Under our administration, we�ve accomplished more in four short years than most presidents dream of accomplishing in eight years. We passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. Record setting regulation cuts. Nobody came close. Fair and reciprocal trade deals. We got rid of NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever made. Now we have the USMCA and we stood up to China like never before. We charged them tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We never took in 25 cents from China. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then we did it again. We had to do it twice and now it�s being destroyed, rapidly destroyed by what they�re doing with inflation and other things. We completely rebuilt the United States military. We created Space Force and we selected Huntsville, Alabama as the new headquarters of the US Space Command. Donald Trump: (01:22:50) I made a lot of enemies. I�ve made so many and a lot of states wanted it, but we put it in Alabama and that was not an easy one. You think this stuff is easy. It�s not so easy. By contrast, no administration in history has gotten off to a worst start then the Biden administration. There�s never been anything like this. And I thought about that statement before it happened with the disaster that we�re witnessing in Afghanistan. Joe Biden is a failed president. He will always be a failed president. He�s ushered in one calamity after another. When I left office, I handed Biden three vaccines to end the pandemic in record time, as I said, and yet under his leadership, the virus is surging back. Could you imagine if I were president and the virus was surging back? She said it wouldn�t be. It wouldn�t come back. Yeah, that one�s actually tougher than the Taliban. I must be honest with you. But he�s reimposing mask mandates and threatening new restrictions on the American people meanwhile. Many, many new restrictions. Meanwhile, 21% of migrant youth who recently crossed the border reportedly have COVID and they don�t have to do anything. They don�t have to wear masks. They don�t have to go through testing. They don�t have to do anything. And the country is being infected by what�s coming over the border. And not only with COVID. Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. And as I said, it�s okay for Russia, but no good for us. Remember when he said we will not approve the America first agenda. I said, that�s a killer statement. Isn�t it? But he actually believes that, America first, the greatest I think we�ve ever had, the greatest statement as to what we want to do with our country. And he said, �We are not for America first.� I said, did anybody actually tell him to say that? Donald Trump: (01:25:03) He attacked oil and gas workers here in America and caused gas prices to skyrocket, yet now he is begging OPEC for more production to please send energy our way. Please send oil gas to our country. And six months ago we had so much, we didn�t know what the hell to do with it. Unbelievable. He shut a lot of it down, had nothing to do with the environment. It�s called an environmental hoax. He did the exact opposite. I broke OPEC and I broke the cartel. You saw what was happening. We actually had a moment in time where oil prices went down per barrel to minus $37. In other words, if you took a barrel of oil, they gave you $37. I told my people, why didn�t you do that? We would�ve gotten paid to take the oil. That was too much because it was going to destroy our industry. But we did fill up the national oil reserves that were empty for years. And we filled them up with very cheap oil. And now Biden wants to use that to supplement what we have. We shouldn�t do that. Donald Trump: (01:26:17) We achieved American energy independence, and we turned America into the number one energy super power in the world. We were bigger than Saudi Arabia by a lot. We were bigger than Russia by a lot. And now we�re going back to them asking them for help. Do you believe this? Biden and the radical Democrats are also pushing a $4.7 trillion spending Bonanza that is nothing but a down payment on the socialist Green New Deal. Build your buildings. Please don�t put windows in your building. That�s one of the ones that we don�t want windows to be in the building. And if they are, they want them to be very small. Take the buildings down in New York and build new buildings with smaller windows. Donald Trump: (01:27:05) Between the phony infrastructure bill and the budget proposal, their package would abolish the suburbs, totally abolish. They said I lost people in the suburbs. I�m the one that got them to stop building horrible low-income housing that was going to destroy the suburbs. And they�re saying that I didn�t do well in the suburbs. I think I did great in the suburbs. I think the women in suburbs voted for Donald Trump. That�s what I think. I do think. We had a rigged election. They give Congress unchecked authority to raise your taxes. You will be getting the biggest tax increase in history if they�re allowed to do what they are trying to do, allow the government to try taxing America drivers by the mile. They want to tax you by the mile and grant a backdoor mass amnesty to illegal aliens. The radical Democrat party and their media allies are completely and totally corrupt. The same people who want you to believe there was no election fraud are the ones who said there was no spying in my campaign. Donald Trump: (01:28:16) Remember, they spied my campaign? I said, �They�re spying on my campaign,� and the world went crazy. I thought it was just an innocent statement because we know they�re dishonest. The world went crazy when I said they�re spying and it turned out that to be true. They perpetrated the Russia hoax. They framed General Flynn. They conducted the Mueller witch hunt, never ending Mueller witch hunt. They�re continuing to do it with very dishonest, highly political prosecutors, all over the place. They�re using justice to go after Republicans. And we can�t let that happen, because again, we�re not going to have a country left. And they pushed the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two, who ruthlessly smeared Brett Kavanaugh. Do you remember how they went after Brett Kavanaugh? He was with this one. He was with that one. He wasn�t with any of them. And they knew that, but you know, they�re trying to scare our Supreme Court. Donald Trump: (01:29:22) And they�re trying to scare people like Bill Barr and others. By going after him, they try and scare him because they say they�re going to pack the court or they�re going to impeach Bill Barr. And you know, it changes some people. It really does. It changes them. It scares them. They don�t want that to happen. They talk about, they want to impeach Kavanaugh. You know what they want to impeach him for? Nothing. He didn�t do anything wrong. In fact, the opposite, they did everything wrong. They were total dishonest people. One of the most horrendous hearings that anyone�s seen, they covered up the origins of the China virus. And they censored all information about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and all of the corruption in that family. Donald Trump: (01:30:06) Just recently, it was revealed that Google rewrote its whole program. You saw that, in order to target Donald Trump, they targeted me. And yet, we still got 75 million votes. How the hell did we do that? But really the number wasn�t 75 million. I believe the number was many, many, many millions more. You know, it�s funny. I have a rally like this that goes way the hell back. By the way, it�s starting to rain. I will prove to you it�s my hair. Donald Trump: (01:30:50) But everyone in here knows that the radical left will stop at nothing to destroy the America we love. We�re not going to let it happen. All of you in Alabama and with conservative patriots like Mo Brooks and others and all of the names I mentioned are fighting for us in Washington. And I have never been more confident that we will defeat the radical left. And we have to. We don�t have a choice. These are vicious people and they stick together. They don�t have Mitt Romney and these guys that go off on their own, they don�t have people like that. Little Ben Sasse. He said nothing. They don�t have people like this. They have people that stick together. I respect them for that, but I don�t respect them for trying to destroy our country. Donald Trump: (01:31:39) With a Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for American families, fair trade for American workers. And we�ve done more on trade deals than any other administration in the history of our country, including the China deal, which I don�t even talk about it anymore because of COVID but the China deal has made our farmers rich. Our farmers and manufacturers have never done better. And more American factories, forging more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, made in the USA. Donald Trump: (01:32:18) So in conclusion, our movement is up against some of the most sinister forces and entrenched interests that anyone can even imagine. But no matter how big our way of life, no matter how big our country or how powerful they may seem, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our magnificent American Liberty is your God given right. The citizens of the United States of America will not be dictated to and talked down to by incompetent politicians, corrupt tyrants, left-wing bullies, or socialist bureaucrats in Washington, DC, a place that I got to know very, very well. Donald Trump: (01:33:25) We are descended from the heroes and the patriots, the pioneers and the legends who tame the great wilderness, who settled this vast continent and who laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest- Donald Trump: (01:33:55) � we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. And there is no challenge we cannot meet. We are Americans and the future belongs to us. We�re going to have a great future. We are going to turn this mess around. This is a horrible thing that�s happening to our country. We�re left out all over the world. We�re not going to be left at anymore. This is a horrible, horrible thing. And it�s going to go on for awhile, but we�ve got to end it. We cannot let this happen. They�re destroying our country. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. Donald Trump: (01:34:50) My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this. There�s never been anything like it. People run for the Senate. They do okay. They lose. They win a couple of votes and they�re national heroes for 50 years. They�re on television, talking. People running for president and they come in second, third, or fourth in one primary. And they�re national heroes all of a sudden. We, not me. We ran for president and we won 32 states. And then we did better the second time, much better the second time, much, much better. Somebody from the fake news media said, �Sir, what was the difference between 2016 and 2020?� I said, �Well, the difference was that in 2020, we did much, much better. The rallies were bigger. The enthusiasm was more.� Donald Trump: (01:35:56) Because in 2016, I told you what we were going to do, but it was talk. In 2020, you knew that I did it. So we had a much better, but we were cheated. And it was rigged. We were cheated, but there�s never been a movement like this. And you know, it�s funny. I say it a lot. And with the fake news, look at all of them back there, the fake news is back there. They never ever question it. If I say something that�s close to wrong, it�s headline news. But I say, this is the greatest rally in the history of our country, this is the greatest movement in the history of our country. There�s never been anything like it. Donald Trump: (01:36:41) And it�s probably the greatest movement in the history of our world. It�s probably, this movement. Call it, make America great again, call it America first, call it what you will. I believe it�s the greatest movement probably in the history of the world. It�s just starting. It�s just starting. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So with love of our nation, swelling in our hearts, and it does swell in your hearts. That�s why you�re standing here in the rain, listening to this person. You�re saying, �Darling, it�s raining. Let�s go home.� But nobody is leaving all the way back hundreds and like football fields behind, football fields. �Darling, it�s raining,� but they say, �We�re not going home because we love our country.� Donald Trump: (01:37:40) But with swelling in our hearts, the spirit of America is stirring ourselves. And I say these words to you, and you�ve heard these words before, in some cases many times before, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America, despite what you�re seeing today so sad and so pathetic, we will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And you know what it is, we will make America great again. Thank you Alabama. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much.'
