                var quotes = 'As long as you are going to be thinking anyway, think big: Show me someone without an ego, and Ill show you a loser.: When you are wronged repeatedly, the worst thing you can do is continue taking it--fight back!: What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate: It doesn`t hurt to get more education.: Sometimes your best investments are the ones you dont make.: Were rounding em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And theyre going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesnt sound nice. But not everything is nice: What I wont do is take in two hundred thousand Syrians who could be ISIS... I have been watching this migration. And I see the people. I mean, theyre men. Theyre mostly men, and theyre strong men. These are physically young, strong men. They look like prime-time soldiers. Now its probably not true, but where are the women?... So, you ask two things. Number one, why arent they fighting for their country? And number two, I dont want these people coming over here.: I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.: I think I could have stopped it because I have very tough illegal immigration policies, and people arent coming into this country unless theyre vetted and vetted properly.: we build a school, we build a road, they blow up the school, we build another school, we build another road, they blow them up, we build again. In the meantime we cant get a fucking school in Brooklyn.: I will be phenomenal to the women. I mean, I want to help women.: Its like in golf... A lot of people - I dont want this to sound trivial - but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive... its weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they cant sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.: I have a great relationship with African Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them.: The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA-infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great - but must suffer the consequences!: Its really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming: No matter what you do - guns, no guns - it doesnt matter. You have people that are mentally ill. And theyre gonna come through the cracks. And theyre going to do things that people will not even believe are possible.: Our country is in serious trouble. We dont have victories any more. We used to have victories but [now] we dont have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, lets say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.: Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.": When you see the other side chopping off heads, waterboarding doesnt sound very severe.: Well, if I ever ran for office, Id do better as a Democrat than as a Republican - and thats not because Id be more liberal, because Im conservative. But the working guy would elect me. He likes me. When I walk down the street, those cabbies start yelling out their windows.: The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. Ive been challenged by so many people and I dont, frankly, have time for total political correctness.: To be blunt, people would vote for me. They just would. Why? Maybe because Im so good looking.: The line of Make America great again, the phrase, that was mine, I came up with it about a year ago, and I kept using it, and everybodys using it, they are all loving it. I dont know, I guess I should copyright it, maybe I have copyrighted it.: If Hillary Clinton cant satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?: If you look at Saddam Hussein, he killed terrorist: s. Im not saying he was an angel, but this guy killed terrorists.:'
